I'm sure most people by now have had a chance to read the article by Bruce 
regarding software patents... one of the concepts he brings up is an 
organization to work for the community in helping with patent related 
issues.  SPI is mentioned as one of the possibilities, FSF as another.  What 
do people think of this idea, and how should the problem in general be 
approached?

I agree with Bruce, and I think SPI would be an excellent vehicle for
this.

We need to firm up our position on IPR we hold, and publish a
statement about what the rules will be for such patents, and then we
should post an announcement requesting that free software developers
who have had what they think might be patentable ideas contact us.

Ian.

I'm very interested in joining SPI as a member. What is the process for
doing so? I am currently a registered debian developer, and i understand
that it was formerly the case that all debian developers were (by virtue
of such position) members of SPI. If this is no longer the case, does
anyone know the application procedure?

We have a problem with Harmony. One of the earlier authors
is getting worried about possible legal action. I don't think
he has anything to fear, but he has asked us to replace his
sources.

Would he still be legally responsible if he transferred all
rights to another party? If we can guarantee his safety he
has agreed to let us use his sources.

Is it possible for SPI to serve as a legal umbrella for the
new Harmony project? I do not fear a lawsuit, but just in case.

As they say, the only person who can safely be appointed to a position
of power is the one who doesn't want that honour.

Richard Stallman isn't interested in the label "Open Software" in the
slightest (as he has made very clear), so the FSF would make a good,
neutral custodian for the trademark on behalf of all those wishing to
use it. There is no way it would be abused to feather the FSF's own
nest, a definite danger elsewhere.

SPI, OSI (not a good choice of name!) and any number of other OSS
organizations can perform their roles perfectly adequately without
holding the trademark themselves. In fact, it would be a bad idea if
one of them were to hold it in an exclusive manner, since this would
then make other similar organizations operate in some sense as second
class citizens, ie. in a subsidiary capacity. That would not be
even-handed, and it's easy to see much bad feeling developing from
such a skewed setup --- we see the start of that already.

In contrast, in the FSF it would in effect lie in a sort of
undisturbed "glass case", a place of esteem for the latest emblem of
the community. I think this would work well.

I understand this sentiment, but I don't agree with it in this case. As the
events of this year have shown, "Open Source" works well as a marketing tool
for free software, and does not, when properly managed (including, when
needed, defended) weaken the politics of free software.

(Also, to some extent, the fact that SPI has chosen to consult the free
software community in the trademark issue, is an argument for it not being
in the "game" for power's sake).

There's more to the trademark than use: there is also the issue of defending
the trademark. Would the FSF be willing to sue (and thus potentially commit
a lot of money) to defend a trademark it isn't interested in?
Also, when Open Source is held by the FSF, how would the definition of the
term be managed (it is to some degree desirable to be able to modify the
definition in the future, to clarify aspects unaddressed so far, and follow
the collective opinion of the free software community)?

Hi,

since we're hosting more and more mailing lists for several projects
I'd like to create a new hostname for them.  If the supported project
provides their own hostname (like berlin-consortium.org or
zinc.rulez.org) we can use this domain without a major problem.

If the project doesn't provide a hostname of their own we currently
use other.debian.org as hostname.  I would like to use a different
one.  Canonical I could install other.spi-inc.org however I also
consider projects.spi-inc.org.

I'm open to good ideas.

Regards,

	Joey

Specificlly I'm interested in structural engineering, but I also would love
to work on some hydraulics or other simlar software. I'm willing to work on
anything from a very small single purpose program, to an entire environment
for major project development. If anyone already has such a project
underway I'd love to hear about it, if not, please email me and maybe we
can start one.

[Background, for those not on the Debian lists: Ian has made a controversial
proposal ("DFSG2") for a new version of the Debian Free Software Guidelines,
which would make some software that's currently considered free, considered
non-free.]

IMO, this depends a lot on who controls / ends up controlling the Open
Source Definition. If it's SPI, it's not unthinkable to me that there'll be
updated versions of the OSD, which could might track at least some of the
changes in the DFSG. While this doesn't exclude the possibility of two
standards, in this scenario the gap between them might well be small. 

Open Source's purpose was to be a marketing tool for free software. Having
the DFSG and the OSD diverge would make Open Source a lot less useful from
my perspective.

   It was the _League for Programming Freedom_. Their web site,

AFAIK the LPF never had www.lpf.org.  At any rate, the current website

SPI:

A short while ago I sent a response to the "consultation" announcement.  I would like to apologize to Dale Scheetz 

for the implications I made in that mail, and ask his forgiveness for I was simply wrong.  Dale is of outstanding 

character and I never should have questioned that.  If you've not read that message, don't bother.  It added no value 

to the discussion anyway.  Having mistaken him for one of the bad guys, he has been kind and gracious in 

explaining how I was mistaken and I thank him for it.  I don't mean to waste bandwitdth with this stuff, but it was 

important to me to send this.  Thanks.

Best regards,

Richard G. Roberto

I have seen no responses made public yet, nor any statement from SPI
regarding the "Open Source" trademark situation, nor any indication if (and
if so, how) the trademark situation is affected by Bruce Perens' statement
regarding his resignation from OSI (widely publicised and discussed in free
software news media, e.g.
http://slashdot.org/articles/99/02/18/0927202.shtml), in which he accuses
OSI (and Eric Raymond in particular) of having lost the free software focus,
and hints at unconscionable abuse of the Open Source mark.

The opensource.org domain still has "Software in the Public Interest" as its
registrant, and http://www.spi-inc.org/trademarks still says "The Open
Source trademark is managed by Eric Raymond on behalf of the free software
community". However, http://www.opensource.org/osi-launch.html still claims
SPI transfered the "Open Source" mark to Eric Raymond and that OSI's
"mission will be to own and defend the Open Source trademark, [...]".

In short, the "Open Source" trademark situation is still a mess, and there's
a distinct possibility of it getting even messier, and I've seen no signs of
activity by SPI to untangle this mess since the announcement I quoted
earlier.

Needless to say, I find this extremely disappointing. I can only express my
(unfortunately increasingly dwindling) hope that SPI will act now, and act
in an open fashion to resolve this issue.

Agree, agree, agree, in general.

Having been subscribed to the SPI board list for some time I think the 
problems center around:

- The board being generally too busy with personal matters to draft or
  decide action on the mark.

- A general hesitance to piss ESR or OSI in general off.

I think that getting more people involved would help raise confidence
in taking independant action and would create more calories of human
energy to attack these problems with.

The announced "Consultation about the Open Source trademark", posted
on Nov 24 1998, states:

    The consultation period will end at midnight at the end of the
    calendar year 1998, UTC. All consultation responses will be made
    public by SPI after the consultation period has closed, unless the
    respondent specifically requests otherwise.

Being well after new-year, I believe time has come to clean up this
mess one way or another.  It does seem like SPI can expect solid
support for its position - at least if the only other alternative is
to legally transfer the mark to OSI.

Here's a resolution I'm working on to address concerns about who has 
control of what equipment etc.  Please comment on this, and feel free to 
propose additions, changes, etc.  I would like this resolution to address 
all relevant issues that may come up with donations or loans of equipment 
and services, but also want to keep the resolution general.

Nils.


---------------------------------------------------------------
-Proposed Draft- Resolution 1999.03.03.nl
Guidelines for Equipment and Service Donations
---------------------------------------------------------------


General Guidelines for Donations
--------------------------------

- All equipment and services donated to SPI or any of its affiliated 
projects must be used in compliance with any and all applicable laws

- All equipment will be used to further the goals of SPI and its 
affiliated projects, and will be used in accordance with all SPI rules and 
regulations.

- The criteria for differentiating between donated and loaned equipment 
shall be whether or not a transfer of ownership from the donor to SPI has 
taken place.


Equipment Guidelines
--------------------

- Donations of equipment can be marked for a specific project, or for SPI 
in general.  The latter is preferred as it allows SPI more flexibility in 
the usage of equipment.

- Equipment can be donated for a specific purpose.  SPI will make every 
attempt to use it for the specified purpose, but may at its discretion 
(and the discretion of the project that it was earmarked for, if 
applicable) change its use if this is deemed necessary.

- Equipment that is on loan to SPI or an affiliated project will be 
considered a service, and will be used under the service guidelines.


Service Guidelines
------------------

- Any restrictions on donations or their usage must be stated at the time 
of donation.

- If the donor wishes to change the conditions under which the service is 
donated or withdraw the service, he must inform SPI (and the project that 
the service is donated to, if applicable) 15 days in advance.

- If SPI (or the project that the service is donated to, if applicable) 
wishes to change the usage of the service, or use the service in a manner 
contrary to that initially specified, they must inform the provider of the 
service 15 days in advance.

This is a good start but fails to address some of the fundamental issues.

The language about donated -vs- loaned equipment is useful but is somewhat
a given considering the default laws surrounding bill of sale and transfer
of ownership.

I think one of the most important issues is what "donated for SPI usage"
entails. I would think something along these lines would be useful:

- Services and equipment which are donated to SPI for general use will 
be utilized only for projects which are officially affiliated with SPI.
Any special utilization of donated services or equipment for projects
that are not officially affiliated will be subject to the permission
of the donor and the rules spelled out in the "Support in Temporary,
Emergency or Other Unusual Circumstances" section.

The "Support in Temporary, Emergency or Other Unusual Circumstances"
section should specify clearly the situations which warrant the use
of SPI resources outside the typical project support guidelines and
the reasons that warrant such utilization. The key being that SPI
"support" should typically be going to officially supported projects.
I can see that there should be policy for facilitating responsiveness
in quick-turn situations such as the LDP issue but these situations
should be the exception and not the rule. It should also be insured
that projects are not allowed to remain in this limbo state and are
moved into an officially supported position or are removed.

I can try to work on a clearer Temporary / Emergency section. Perhaps
we should set up CVS to manage these documents? Does that seem
useful?

Hmmm... that would make a lot of things tougher, hosting of a mailing 
list, offering some FTP space, at this point you're tying SPI and the 
projects down in terms of their reactivity.  I'd suggest not putting this, 
but rather something along the lines of 'within the SPI goals' to leave it 
general.  Plus you said donated- if equipment is donated it's SPI's and 
the donor has no say, if it's a service/loan, then that could apply.  But 
I'd still rather leave his resolution general and ask the donor to put 
that clause into the service agreement at the start of the loan- makes 
thing easier on all parties I think.

Not sure I agree with this... lots of little projects can use a mailing 
list, a little FTP space, etc. but don't necessarily need to become SPI 
affiliated.  Remember, affiliation means we manage money, equipment etc. 
for them.  I think it's a good idea if the bigger ones become affiliated, 
but smaller ones I would like exempt from this requirement.


Nils.

ps. I don't think we need cvs for this, the mailing list should be 
sufficient with the proposer keeping track of the revs.

Dear Senator/Representative,

As the software world is becoming more open, it seems more clear than
ever that Intellectual Property law in the US, and in particular
the ability to patent software algorithms, is a hindrance rather than
an aid for future innovation.

USA is alone in honoring patents for such algorithms (at least in the
western world).  Innovation that could take place here is therefore
only possible abroad - such as in the EU or Japan.  One example is the
task bar in Microsoft Windows, which has been awarded a US patent.
Though prior art could easily be referred to should a case ever come
up, such a case would be very costly for a small entity fighting
Microsoft's massive legal apparatus.  As a result, other graphical
user interfaces are nowadays mostly developed in Europe (for instance,
the KDE and GNOME interfaces for UNIX).

I am also writing this despite being a primary applicant for a US
software patent.  While my invention is general in nature, my company
felt that we needed to protect ourselves from lawsuits by _other_
companies who _in the future_ might make a similar invention, by
applying first.

As you see, these laws are more than anything aimed at protecting
corporations from competition - and in the long run tend to have a
terrible effect on the emerging trend of colaborative development.

Thank you for your kind consideration,

Tor Slettnes

I agree with these sentiments. I think that we can go much further than
writing our congress, however. I would like to see us assemble a class
action law suit against the federal government with the purpose of declaring
that the current U.S. Patent system violates the garaunteed right to 
freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is arguably the most important
right granted in the constitution and intellectual property has become
a thinly veiled sham that grants corporations nearly absolute control
over the basic components from which new ideas are constructed. At the
current rate, in some short time it will become nearly impossible for 
hobbyist programmers to practice their art without risking the violation
of some overly broad patent.

Is any effort similar to this idea under way?

That is exactly what I am doing. Just like the Debian packaging policies
tie down a developer's "reactivity". Donating services is the only thing
that SPI does. The concept that this should be completely free-form and
not depend on making a project "officially SPI endorsed" is a bit odd.

SPI's mission is to give aid and assistance. If SPI gives aid and assistance
to a project then it is "SPI associated". Perhaps we can have different
levels of affiliation that provide different levels of service.

OK, I see where you're going... maybe officially endorsed is a bit too 
much.  SPI is intended to provide services to the projects that don't have 
the HW etc. to do it with... they need to share and be compatible with the 
SPI goals, but I don't think officially endorsed sounds right.  I wouldn't 
call a project that's got a mailing list hosted by us an 'official' 
project... maybe that should be reserved for projects for whom we handle 
money and hardware, not just mail, web, ftp, or cvs space...

That I agree with... the question is why would we need to define different 
levels?  I agree we should track project sizes, and the services they're 
using, but do we need to define levels?  As above, maybe money/hw handling 
vs. handling that plus the rest?

Nils.

ps. this is getting off topic from the equipment guidelines a little.  I 
still like the guidelines that I initially proposed.  I'll repost that 
with a few changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------
-Proposed Draft 2- Resolution 1999.03.03.nl
Guidelines for Equipment and Service Donations
---------------------------------------------------------------


General Guidelines for Donations
--------------------------------

- All equipment will be used to further the goals of SPI and its 
affiliated projects, and will be used in accordance with all SPI rules and 
regulations.

- All equipment and services donated to SPI or any of its affiliated 
projects must be used in compliance with any and all applicable laws.

- The criteria for differentiating between donated and loaned equipment 
shall be whether or not a transfer of ownership from the donor to SPI has 
taken place.


Equipment Guidelines
--------------------

- Donations of equipment can be marked for a specific project, or for SPI 
in general.  The latter is preferred as it allows SPI more flexibility in 
the usage of equipment.

- Equipment can be donated for a specific purpose.  SPI will make every 
attempt to use it for the specified purpose, but may at its discretion 
(and the discretion of the project that it was earmarked for, if 
applicable) change its use if this is deemed necessary.

- Equipment that is donated for a specific purpose must have that purpose 
clearly defined at the time of the donation.

- Equipment that is on loan to SPI or an affiliated project will be 
considered a service, and will be used under the service guidelines.


Service Guidelines
------------------

- Any restrictions on donations or their usage must be stated at the time 
of donation.

- If the donor wishes to change the conditions under which the service is 
donated or withdraw the service, he must inform SPI (and the project that 
the service is donated to, if applicable) 15 days in advance.

- If SPI (or the project that the service is donated to, if applicable) 
wishes to change the usage of the service, or use the service in a manner 
contrary to that initially specified, they must inform the provider of the 
service 15 days in advance.

I see that new discussion came up covering what I tried to start
back in december.  In order to put some oil in the chains here
is what I proposed last year.

I saw that.. I was trying to get something more general than this though, 
that way you can apply it to any service more easily.  The specific 
restrictions are left to the specific donation/loan in this case, which I 
think offers more flexibility to both parties and makes more sense.  If 
you think there are core ideas missing from what I've posted, please 
comment.

Nils.

Doesn't this make earmarking kind of pointless? There should be a
restriction in here.

I think you need a loophole in here that in some situations a donator
can require immediate termination. For example if something weird
happens and the donator might get into legal problems or thinks that
SPI abuses the donations.

I also miss the ability to earmark donations for a specific goal. A
donator should be able to say for example `I have this listserver you
can use, but only for security-related projects', or any other possible
restriction. Without this it is also impossible to make a donation
specifically for a single SPI project, such as Debian.

Wichert.

    I have been doing some reading on copyright/patent law for software
(though I am not a lawyer!), and from what I've read, it seems the courts
are inclined to take into account whether or not the supposed infringement
was in the public interest or not.
    Also looks like reverse engineering by disassembly may be all right,
_if_ you have an authorized copy, and it's the only (reasonable) way to
get at the non-copyrightable elements of the software (ideas and facts).
   If the software is covered by a patent, that's a point in your favor
too, since patents are supposed to encourage opening up ideas, not adding
extra locks on them.
  Warning: above is my interpretation of legal gobbledy-gook - whether
it's true or not I don't know.  What I am pretty sure about is that the
results of an infringement suit (copyright or patent) will probably be up
in the air until a lawsuit has actually gone to trial.

Lynn
PS.  I might agree with the class action lawsuit, but more because the
govt. is being negligent in its assignment of patents thereby giving out
govt-backed clubs for harrassment of potential software developers.

For the purposes of this agreement, "equipment" is understood to mean
any physical or monetary asset that is given, transferred or
otherwise donated to SPI for the purposes of furthering the SPI
effort or a SPI affiliated project.

- Any restrictions on donations or their usage must be stated at the time 
of donation. These restrictions are not subject to change after the assets 
have been transferred to SPI.

[edit of above]
- Equipment can be donated for a specific purpose.  SPI will make every 
attempt to use it for the specified purpose, but may at its discretion 
(and the discretion of the project that it was earmarked for, if 
applicable) change its use if this is deemed necessary and does not
violate any of the restrictions imposed by the donor.

For the purposes of this agreement, "service" is understood to mean
any asset which SPI has been granted use of, but does not own, for
the purposes of furthering the SPI effort or a SPI affiliated
projects. This might include, but is not limited to, donated network
bandwidth, usage of computing equipment or other physical equipment,
usage of space within a technical facility or other facility, or
services of personnel.

[Changes from Ean incorporated (thanks, Ean.  Good changes!).  I moved the 
restrictions at time of donation into the general section- made more sense 
there.  Looks like the resolution is close to mature.  Nils.]

---------------------------------------------------------------
-Proposed Draft 3- Resolution 1999.03.03.nl
Guidelines for Equipment and Service Donations
---------------------------------------------------------------

General Guidelines for Donations
--------------------------------

- All equipment will be used to further the goals of SPI and its 
affiliated projects, and will be used in accordance with all SPI rules and 
regulations.

- All equipment and services donated to SPI or any of its affiliated 
projects must be used in compliance with any and all applicable laws.

- The criteria for differentiating between donated and loaned equipment 
shall be whether or not a transfer of ownership from the donor to SPI has 
taken place.

- Any restrictions or usage requirements on donations must be stated at 
the time of donation. These restrictions are not subject to change after 
the assets have been transferred to SPI.  Restrictions on loans may be 
changed as described below.


Equipment Guidelines
--------------------

For the purposes of this agreement, "equipment" is understood to mean any 
physical or monetary asset that is given, transferred or otherwise donated 
to SPI for the purposes of furthering the SPI effort or a SPI affiliated 
project.

- Donations of equipment can be marked for a specific project, or for SPI 
in general.  The latter is preferred as it allows SPI more flexibility in 
the usage of equipment.

- Equipment can be donated for a specific purpose.  SPI will make every 
attempt to use it for the specified purpose, but may at its discretion 
(and the discretion of the project that it was earmarked for, if 
applicable) change its use if this is deemed necessary and does not
violate any of the restrictions imposed by the donor.

- Equipment that is on loan to SPI or an affiliated project will be 
considered a service, and will be used under the service guidelines.


Service Guidelines
------------------

For the purposes of this agreement, "service" is understood to mean any 
asset which SPI has been granted use of, but does not own, for the 
purposes of furthering the SPI effort or a SPI affiliated projects. This 
might include, but is not limited to, donated network bandwidth, usage of 
computing equipment or other physical equipment, usage of space within a 
technical facility or other facility, or services of personnel.

- If the donor wishes to change the conditions under which the service is 
donated or withdraw the service, they must inform SPI (and the project 
that the service is donated to, if applicable) 15 days in advance.

- If SPI (or the project that the service is donated to, if applicable) 
wishes to change the usage of the service, or use the service in a manner 
contrary to that initially specified, they must inform the provider of the 
service 15 days in advance.

Oops, just noticed the singular/plural conflict in "a SPI affiliated
projects". Third line. Sorry.

AFAIK IBM is marketing postfix (AKA "IBM Secure Mailer") as open source,
even if there is a conflicting clause in the license.

I think debian or SPI should officially complain: if we don't act then
the trade mark will be diluited and we could lose it.

I understand the author (Wietse Venema) is willing to make it free but
needs arguments for IBM lawyers.

   Could there be a clause stating where descriptions of purposes may be
found?  This might help provide a common reference for projects.  I'm
particularly thinking that 2 people might want their donations to be used
for the same purpose, but described differently, particularly when there's
no existent effort to fulfill the purpose, or the purpose is an
intermittent one.  Like if someone donated money toward the legal defense
of free software developers on patent infringement suits.  Or services,
from lawyers.
   Also, a site describing the current funding status of the different
projects/purposes might be helpful in determining where one wants to 
dedicate their money (in some cases, you might decide not to donate for
a very under-funded one as compared to a better-funded one that
seems to be gathering some momentum.  or you might make the opposite
decision).

I haven't followed the discussion of the PostFix license in detail, but I
think we should have clear answers to the following questions should be
answered before we contact IBM officially:
- The conflicting clause is the revocation in case of patent issues one,
  right?
- Does the clause actually violate the OSD, or is it an oversight in the
  OSD/DFSG? If it is the latter, is it fixed in the current DFSG revision
  proposal drafts?
- Is the issue with PostFix only, or is it with Jikes too?

> I think debian or SPI should officially complain:

SPI holds the Open Source cerficiation mark, not Debian. What Debian can do
is to take this issue into account in the next DFSG revision.

I remember this has been discussed on debian-legal but I did not follow
the thread and I'm not able to comment.

 >- Is the issue with PostFix only, or is it with Jikes too?
IIRC the license is the same or very similar, but I could be wrong.

I do not believe it's forbidden in the current DFSG.  It has been addressed
in the draft to make clauses like this non-DFSG-free.

I'd rather not write that into the resolution as it's a technicality, not 
a general rule. I argee that this would be valuable, and it's something 
that we should probably put on our web site in the project pages.

  Yes, it would be.  This could also go on the project pages.

It might be wise to consider requiring people to not require a purpose for
donations to SPI but allow general use. 

If we allow a specifications of purpose:

Who is going to track that and make sure it is really used like that?

We need then to have a database of machines etc etc which is quite a
headache.

Given our limited administrative capabilities I dont think its wise to
allow people to restrict use for a certain purpose. Maybe restrict use for
a project but then the project should track the stuff.

I agree with Mr. Dassen regarding the urgency of resolving this situation.
Inaction by SPI will only increase the anxiety many people are
feeling about this matter.

Given the lack of public comment about the trademark, despite early
promises of action, it would seem that the disposition of the mark is not
really important to SPI. I, for one, would like to see the trademark
managed actively and without dispute. While the community is divided over
this issue, education and outreach about Open Source will retain the taint
of the dispute.

[This resolution lays down some basic definitions that will become 
important later on when the bylaws changes will be discussed- especially 
the voting section.  We will probably end up with different approvals for 
motions and resolutions- i.e. it should be easier to add the hosting of a 
mailing list to SPI that it should be to change the bylaws themselves. 
This resolution will be a building block for later discussions.

Comments/additions are welcome.  I know some of this is awkwardly worded, 
so please feel free to suggest improvements. --Nils]


---------------------------------------------------------------
-Proposed Draft- Resolution 1999-03-15.nl
Definition of Motions and Resolutions
---------------------------------------------------------------

This resolution defines the purposes and usages of resolutions and 
motions.  The approval of resolutions and motions will not be discussed in 
this document, but will follow the procedures outlined in the bylaws.  
Resolutions add or change procedures for the operation of SPI, but should 
(if possible) not include technical information.  Resolutions should be 
written generically so that they may be widely applied.


Resolutions
-----------
  A resolution shall be used when it is necessary to define a principle, 
procedure or operating guideline that changes the basic operation and 
administration of SPI.  It

Example resolutions include changing the SPI bylaws, establishing new 
procedures or guidelines of operation, and similar decisions.


Motions
-------
  A motion shall be used to change technical details within the operation 
of SPI.  These changes are only allowed to happen within the 
organizational framework of SPI as outlined by the charter, bylaws, and 
previous resolutions.  A motion changes or adds operational information, 
but does not change the basic operations of SPI.

Example motions include the acceptance of new projects, nominations of 
board members, and other technical issues.

I want people to be able to say that a donation may only be used for
Debian, so I really want to keep this in.

That requirement already has caused trouble. Often equipment from one
project will be used for others as well. How will you track those
limitations on equipment?

Keeping a log wouldn't be all that difficult.  We need to keep an
inventory, anyway.

- Equipment can be donated for a specific purpose.  SPI will make every 
attempt to use it for the specified purpose, but may at its discretion 
(and the discretion of the project that it was earmarked for, if 
applicable) change its use if this is deemed necessary and does not
violate any of the restrictions imposed by the donor.


read the 'but may at its discretion' part... perhaps we should remove the 
'...and does not violate any of the restrictions imposed by the donor." 
part?

    Well, I'm not sure it's actually a technicality.  In contrast with
other people on the list who've responded, I think there should be more
of a guarantee that funds will be used for specific purposes, and that
this promise of a site tracking donation/purpose status would help
assure them of that.
    I realize that there are administrative issues to consider.  But
we should also consider the article Jim Thompson wrote on Slashdot
about organizing an "open source donation clearing house" of sorts.
When I read it, my immediate reaction was, "but isn't that part of
what SPI is (planning on) doing?"  
   See, I tend to think there are a lot of people and companies who would
be willing to donate for particular purposes, but not necessarily just
open software, or even when the promise of using the funds is limited.
Furthermore, I think that if SPI limits its guarantees of how money will 
be used, then probably either another non-profit will arise to take and
track those donations, or (worse) the potential donors just won't give
funds.  And neither of those situations is desirable.  A unified front for
donations is very preferable.
   When I say that, keep in mind that I'm thinking that companies (not
just individuals) who need/use particular types of software could
reasonably be persuaded to give for those types of software - not only
would they get to use the software in the future, but unlike just
purchasing licenses, they would get a tax write off, and some guarantee
that the projects they donate for totally die because a particular 
developer loses interest.  This would be a big win for everyone, I think.

This message is not intended to be private.  However, it's posted to
debian-private as a 'heads-up'.  If you care about open source, please
subscribe to spi-general@lists.spi-inc.org, as that's the correct forum
for discussing it.

Please remove debian-private from any Cc:s.

Here's my take on the Apple/Open Source thing:

Don't bite the hand that feeds!  It's *good* news.  Slow down, everyone.
Apple releasing the source code to the bulk of MacOS X is really good
news.  MacOS X is an exciting piece of technology, and it would be
wonderful if it were Open Source.


Now, what do we do about the fact that it's not open source?

For the record:  2.2 (c) of the APSL fails point (3) of the OSD, since it
restricts distribution of modified versions (you may not do so unless you
notify Apple).  9.1, and 12.1 (c) whilst not obviously failing any point
of the OSD, are undesirable. 

In many other ways, however, the license is excellent.  For example, it
expressely grants a license for all Apple patents which the work might
infringe.

IMO, 9.1, which attempts to cover Apple's backs in case of patent
infringement, is adequately covered by 13.6.  12.1 (c) is just plain silly
:-(.  But I'm not a lawyer.


I think we should

a) Send feedback to Apple, expressing pleasure that they wish to open
source their project, and explaining our current problems with the APSL

b) Regain control of the OS mark, and enforce it.  Opensource.org should
have a high-profile front-page saying "The APSL is not currently
considered open-source, because..", "The IBM Jikes licenses is not
currently considered open-source, because..."

I agree. Let's go about it nicely at first, and if a company persists in
labelling something "Open Source" that isn't, use the judical system ("cease
and desist" letters).

Agreed, but most likely that means SPI will have to take back opensource.org
first. Bruce, you're the current administrative contact for opensource.org,
which is registered on behalf of SPI under its old address; what's your take
on this?

I got a few underlying things form the license. One is that if you
distribute modified source, you grant Apple a non-retractable full
license (equivilent to theirs) to your work, and anything under your
control that you used to create the modified version (they specifically
included things used to create it, like compiler, etc.) yet they
specifically have places in their license where they can revoke it.

There are also three seperate clause, that when investigated together,
reveal an alterior motive. If you look at the section mentioned above
that gives Apple rights to your modifications, then look at another
section (sorry no time to quote #.#'s) which says that source code may
be pre-release. A final section which says that final modifications to
the released package (when they take the work and retail it) will not
necessarily fall under the APSL.

I get _1_ thing from the above. Apple wants to release source of
pre-release software, have the the community work on fixing bugs and
adding features (which they then have rights to once you register them
on the website), take those features/fixes and incorporate them into a
final retail product which they will sell (without source) and the
community is left with non-release quality source.

Apple wants to reap all the benefits from us, and not give us full
discolure in return.

Then again, I may be suffering from "big business" paranoia.

Isn't that supposed to be my job?  (suffering from "big business"
paranoia that is)  My take on it was a bit less sinister, but perhaps a
bit misguided.  Seems they want a lot of the same things Netscape wanted
and we already decided those things were okay.

I believe that if we can get Eric to stop calling it Open Source when it
ain't even close, we have a chance to convince Apple to play nice.

That is *not* necessarily true.  The community doesn't loose the original
source code OR the modifications made by the community.  All that would be
needed is some responsible soul from the community to take charge of all
the changes and release a "competing" product *with* all source code.

On the other hand (and I havn't read the license, I'm talking in general
theory) if Apple *does* remove rights to the changes they incorporate from
the community, that would be a Bad Thing.  

I'm amazed at the near total lack of trust in the Gnu developer community
towards their fellow developer.  We have a long history of matching and
surpassing non-free software.  The basic rule is, "anything cathedral can
do, bazaar can do better."  That has been proven time and time again.  So
what if Apple thinks it can abuse that.  Free Software will still put it
together stronger and better... and considering how "fast" corporations
work... the free version will be released before the non-free version no
matter that Apple tries to use pre-release code.  (after all, there is no
such thing as "pre-release" in the bazaar).

Just my $.02 worth...

Given the amount of contention regarding the trademark, the easiest thing to
do would be to place it in the public domain and let it die of lost meaning.

Regarding the domains, before we do something as hostile as to take them
away, I'd make sure we all agreed about that and had discussed it throughly.

If you read the press release, 
  http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=CnU3LubWbu0zuvta4o&FQ=Linux&SymH

you will see towards the bottom:
  "Open Source is a trademark of Apple Computer, Inc."


Like it or not, but now may be neccessary to come up with some of the
documents regarding the trademark, how it was handled initially etc.
Not only for Eric "Shoot Bill, get famous" Raymond, but in actual
legal confronation with Apple.

Please note the press release now has the correct trademark information.  
Sorry about the confusion.

Section 3(a) says that you grant a license equivalent to the Apple
licence to third parties, section 3(b) says you grant Apple an
irrevocable licence to do whatever they want with your code.

I wouldn't call the 3(b) license "equivalent to theirs".


I see they quote Eric Raymond of "The Open Source Initiative" on their
web page - maybe SPI should retract his license to use the trademark
"Open Source" for that organization.

Thanks for pointing this out - that is a good relief.

The trademark is still subject of a dispute between SPI (which had it
registered), and OSI (which claims to have obtained it from SPI).
Eric Raymond is the president/primadonna of OSI.  The one person who
may have the most influence in dealing with this trademark legally is
Bruce Perens, who has publicly pointed out a couple of (minor)
problems with the ASPL.

As that may be, thanks for your clarification.

In good faith, I think that's a typo.  It actually reads:

  NOTE: Apple, the Apple logo, Macintosh, Mac OS, Power Macintosh and
  WebObjects are registered trademarks of Apple Computer, Inc. Open Source
  is a trademark of Apple Computer, Inc.

I don't see a reason why "Apple Computer, Inc." should be mentioned twice. 
It would be interesting to know what they intended to write there...
"Software in the Public Interest"?  I hope.

   It's better, but now it doesn't recognize Open Source as a trademark at
all.  It should (of Software in the Public Interest).

Actually we usually hope this phrase in our trademark language covers 
third party trademarks....

"Additional company and product names may be trademarks or registered 
trademarks of the individual companies and are respectfully acknowledged".

yes -- it was a typo.  The correct release was issued over the wire and 
is now on our website...sorry for any confusion caused.

    It's not the developers I don't trust.  It's the management.  We have
no way of knowing what kind of politics are being played here, i.e. how
much of this arises from their developers thinking its a good idea, vs.
the management seeing it as a free work force.
    I don't expect Apple to go off the deep end in making its source code
open.  I'm sure their lawyers would be tearing their hair out if they did.
On the other hand, I've got better ways to spend my coding time than
contributing to works that can be yanked out of an open state.
   In other words, I'm impressed to see Apple take this step in the right
direction, and not surprised that the first step is somewhat timid in its
scope.  I'm sure someone had to have some guts to even propose the idea
(media blitz or no).  And if I were a Mac owner/user, I would be glad to
have the source code so that I could fix the inevitable bugs that
interfere with daily computing life.  But I have some doubts if I would
release my fixes, when Apple could co-opt them.  
   On the other hand, making modifications to a copy of a program you own
and distributing those modifications is legal with or without Apple's
permission.  But I'm not sure how that would be affected by the "license".

    I believe that if we can get Eric to stop calling it Open Source when it
    ain't even close, we have a chance to convince Apple to play nice.

IS Eric calling it "open source"?  Has the Open Source Initiative said
anything yet about this license?  I would not expect them to endorse a
license which does not give permission to distribute modified
versions.

I have sent mail to fetch a copy of the license so I can see what it
says.

not sure if it was not the mention that it was open source in the sence of the
cited document (somewhere on the opensource site) that made people thing Eric
or other Open source people said it was ...

I'm afraid Eric is.

It says this in Apple's license FAQ.

Yesterday, SPI and Bruce Perens sent Apple a gentle open letter, welcoming
the move, but not proclaiming it OS.

http://perens.com/APSL.html

Today (at least, today in my personal time zone ;), Eric rebutted that, at

http://lwn.net/1999/0318/a/raymond.html

If I gather from the above that you don't have web access from where you
are, Richard, I'm happy to email you any/all of the above.

I haven't seen this mentioned yet: The description of the Open Source 
certification mark as published on the USPTO web site is quite intriguing:

  "The certification mark, as used by authorized persons, certifies that
   the software license conforms to a set of guidelines published by
   software in the public interest."

I.e. Open Source is defined as conformance to guidelines published by 
SPI! That's quite nice, isn't it ?

The complete USPTO entry is at
http://trademarks.uspto.gov/cgi-bin/ifetch4?ENG+ALL+3+921980+0+1+141168+F+2+2+1+MS%2fOpen+AND+MS%2fSource

It's not even that.  Who cares of Apples sees the Free Software community
as a free work force?  We havn't met, but I'm going to assume you don't
work for Apple, but let's say take Apple's source and add the neat FooBar
system that causes apple to blow away Microsoft and even Linux in their
commercial software... and that commercial software is non-free. =20

Surely you, or someone you know that is interested in Apple's software,
will take Apple's released code.. and your change and put together the same
(and probably better) system.  And if Apple also added (but never released)
the barfoo option, the team that's taken of Applzilla will surely implement
it's on barfoo option, too.

As long as Apples doesn't (and it does, so this is all hypothetical) have
that dratted termination clause on the original release of source code,
there is nothing that can stop the Free Software community from having a
free version of Apples' software.

My initial... rant... was directed more at a general situtation.  More
directed at the GPL or nothing people.  That license displays the same lack
of belief in the Free Software community to match and beat the Closed=20
community in anything the Closed community can put out.

To change the topic... Apple even had a pseudo-accepted (we havn't been
loud enough in our objections to reach Apple's ears) example to go by in
IBM.

  The time has come to begin discussing the changes that need to be made 
to the bylaws.  The most important changes will be regarding the 
memberships, and the voting.  Later changes will address committees, etc.  
These will be attacked in order, with membership being first as this is 
currently the more hazy issue, and a lot of questions have been raised 
about it.

The bylaws can be found on the SPI web site at <http://www.spi-inc.org/corp
orate/spi-bylaws>.

Articles 1 and 2 will never change, as they need to stay consistent with 
the COI (Certificate of Incorporation- also online).  Article 3 is the 
membership article, and this will be discussed first.  As this article is 
discussed, please keep in mind that the entire bylaws will be gradually 
revised, so the articles don't necessarily have to be consistent with 
other articles.

Technically, the way the revisions will work is as follows:
- write resolutions to change the various articles (one at a time, to 
avoid confusion and multiple simultaneous discussions- tough to keep track 
of!)
- discuss the resolutions until they're ready to be voted on
- the board will then vote on them.
- once all necessary articles of the bylaws have been changed, they should 
be voted into the actual bylaws as a block.  This ensures that the bylaws 
are not inconsistent with themselves at any given time, and thus avoids 
confusion.

If anyone has any problems with the general approach, please let me know.  
I've been thinking about this a long time (about 5 months) and this is IMO 
the best way to approach the problem.

I plan on posting the proposed changes to the membership articles in the 
next day or so (hopefully).

Nils.

Just to be clear... after the board votes on the revision, ist the revision part of
the bylaws... or does this "new bylaws" not take actual affect until the
final vote on the bylaws as a block?

I have had several discussions with Ian, Joey, and Dale about this, and 
this will be the first time those thoughts are really put down in writing. 
Eventually it would be nice to have a document that contains all of the 
rationales behind the articles- that way people can see the 'spirit of the 
law' as well as the letter.

Actually, before the real 'writing' I'd like to outline a few possible 
scenarios.  I'm not sure which one makes most sense... all have their 
advantages and drawbacks.  I'm somewhat torn between scenarios 1&2- I'm 
not sure which is better suited to SPIs goals.

I'd like to figure out which scenario makes the most sense (and why!!) and 
then figure out the details, and then actually write the bylaws article.  
When commenting on this, please don't just ask questions- also try to 
propose solutions at the same time.

Discussion season is open.

Nils.


Scenario 1:
-----------
  'flat' membership.  In this case everyone who agrees with the principles 
and goals of SPI can become a member.  Voting can be either limited to 
voting for board embers, or voting on resolutions etc. as well (with 
quorums established etc.).

ADVANTAGES:
  - No membership levels (i.e. flat membership)
  - very little administrative work
  - greater membership carries more political weight
  - advantages if members only vote for the board members is that SPI can 
be very reactive (in terms of speed).  If you think about it, you're 
electing the people that listen to the discussions, and then make the 
decisions (i.e. vote on the resolutions that have been developed).

DISADVANTAGES
  - if members vote on resolutions etc. then the voting process will take 
a lot longer.  Thus SPI will be less reactive.  Perhaps the board can be 
permitted to approve a resolution with a super majority (2/3 + 1 or 
something similar)
  - more/less informed members (some will be more/less active) mean 
discussions will likely last longer


Scenario 2:
-----------
  tiered membership.  Have 'contributing members' and 'supporting members' 
where the contributing members have to be active in the free software 
world in some way.
  contributing members can vote on board members and resolutions
  supporting members can not vote, but can propose resolutions

ADVANTAGES:
  - voting is easier since there will be less people who have to vote
  - voters will be more informed since they're more active
  - SPI still gets the large membership base

DISADVANTAGES
  - you need to define contributing (that's not hard) and somehow verify 
that the member is contributing.  A neat idea would be two year 
memberships and at the end of the two years you have to send a mail 
stating what you've done in the last two years for the community.
  - more administrative work- the membership committee has to worry about 
all this
  - do we _want_ to create a difference between members? i.e. the 
discussion is going and someone says 'but I'm a contributing member and 
you're not!'  Yuck.  Ugly.


Scenario 3:
-----------
  only contributing members are allowed.  (I personally don't like this 
option at all.)

ADVANTAGES
  - informed members
  - simpler (shorter) voting periods

DISADVANTAGES
  - much much smaller membership -> less political weight.  If we're 
trying to represent and stand for the community, we should allow anyone in.
  - less of a range of opinions in the discussions and less interest in 
the discussions.  why should non members join in?

For those of you reading this, I've not written this linearly.  For
example, I started with a comment to Scenario 3.

With the three given scenarios, I'd choose this one.  The whole membership
should be given rights to vote on the board *AND* resolutions.  The Board
should appoint any and all committees to a tenure that ends at the board's
next election and the Board/Committee should be given a respectable amount
of freedom to act.  There is no reason we need a resolution to decide that
Apple's or IBM's licenses are not Open Source as claimed and to act.  

Resolutions should be left for guiding the board... but the board and
committee's should have the latitude to "react".

Bad, very bad.  There is only ONE way I'd consider accepting divided
memebership and that would be individual/project.  That would be it and Ean
and I have very opposite views on how that should be organized so I won't
get into it.  Even then, we both agree it would be "flat" WRT privilages.

You forgot the most imporant DISADVANTAGE.  Loss of focus.  SPI is supposed
to exist to promote the interests of Free Software.  How does it do this?
By an eleet membership roster!  I don't think I could even support such a
closed organization.  At the very least, this option should go against
everything SPI stands for.. or was formed to stand for.  I suppose it's an
option, but it should be considered about as much as far as it takes to
throw it out.

Take care in this matter. The truth of the matter is that the Debian
Free Software Guidelines were created by the combined efforts and 
discussions of Debian developers over the several years that Debian
has conducted its effort to build an "all Free Software" operating
system. Via a series of discussions and on-line editing sessions these
best practices were condensed into a single document. While Bruce was
a useful note taker and editor in these events I find his self attribution
of "principal author" a bit self serving.

A particularly illustrative situation is the IBM Jikes license. Bruce
was called in by IBM to analyze their license before it was ever presented
to the public. Bruce declared the license to be Open Source and it was
subsequently released to the public. Many people took issue with the 
patent clause, the termination clause, and other key elements. After
the negative public reaction, Bruce's claim was that IBM had shown him
a version of the license without these items. This is certainly curious
considering that the objectionable material constitutes almost half
of the material in the license. If IBM did show Bruce a different license
it was almost the same one. It seems to me that if a pack of IBM lawyers
were going to call in a subject matter expert that they would not be
inclined to show him an almost completely different license from the
one they intend to release.

In no way should the opinions of a single person be taken as bona-fide
"Open Source" attribution at this time. Anyone who tells you that they
can grant such is almost certainly lying. Both Eric and Bruce have
attempted to bestow the Open Source status on various licenses that 
were found wanting in the eyes of the community. The single best
barometer of Open Sourceness at this juncture would be a period of
public review and feedback from OSI and SPI that states the opinion
of their informed parties. I realize that this is, at best, a slow
and inexact process but the issues are complex and relatively new.

I think one useful concept is to have representative minority veto be
part of the equation. So that there is a special class of members
(board or directing members, if you will) that can fabricate potential
new policies. In certain cases (controlled by policy) there should be
resolutions that can be voted in with a 5 or 7 day veto period. Some
items might be whether a license is Open Source or something like that.

If the motion survives the veto period without recieving a representative
minority veto then it passes. Reasonably, I cannot see much of any
situation that requires such a quick turn around. The only thing I can
think of is press releases representing community opinion. This, however,
is difficult and slow to assess and reasonably could not be fabricated
in a short time frame.

I think we need to be clear what the purpose of the membership is,
from the point of view of the organisation.  From my point of view,
that purpose is control and accountability.  That is:

The membership should/will control SPI, and SPI's board and ultimately
everyone that acts for SPI will be held accountable to the membership.

So, given what SPI's purpose is (broadly speaking, to help the free
software development community by doing certain things that require
legal personality), we can see that that membership ought to be the
people who are supposed to benefit from SPI's abilities as a legal
entity: free software developers.

I see a very real risk that if SPI ends up legally owning significant
amounts of copyrights, patents, trademarks, money and other property,
it could easily become an effective target for `hijacking' by sudden
large numbers of new members, in order to wrest control of SPI's
assets away from their intended purposes.  This kind of thing is
already happening regularly to eg Building Societies[1] in Britain.

[1] A Building Society is a mutual society.  It's a financial
institution, a bit like a savings and loan.

I don't think we can rely on SPI's charter and contracts/trusts with
associated projects to protect us from this kind of thing.  Instead,
we need to make it difficult for `just anybody' to become a voting
member.

Therefore, I'm very strongly opposed to Nils's Scenario 1, with a
completely flat and open membership.

Instead, I believe that voting membership should be open to
individuals who have contributed significantly to the free software
community.  This will, unfortunately, require some effort to
administer, but the alternatives (dictat by the Board vs. the
possibility of hijacking) are much worse.

I don't particularly care whether there is an additional non-voting
`associate membership' or some such.  There seems little point though
- what is the purpose of these associate members ?  Just to make them
feel good ?

Ian.

Ean-
  The current discussion is about the general purpose of membership and 
its structure- we're not discussing voting etc. yet.  Please keep this in 
mind and bring it up again when we discuss the voting after the basic 
membership issues have been decided on.  Do you have any comments 
regarding membership and the three scenarios I proposed?

Nils.

    I was thinking of a two tiered membership in the following way.
[level 1] (significant contributors to free software) 
          right to vote on all policy issues
          can serve on all committees
[level 2] (enthusiasts)
          can vote on non-policy issues (times/places of general meetings,
	      SPI t-shirt design, other things that organizations
              do that don't affect their policy direction).
          can serve on minor committees (non-policy committees) (?)

   Major committees (those making policy decisions/recommedations) would
have their membership voted on by level 1.
   Minor committees could have their membership voted on by everyone.  
This is because, while enthusiasts might not be good programmers, they
still might be very good at evangelizing and spreading the word.
Actually, it's likely there are be non-programming types who are much
at PR than the programmers.
   
   This brings me to a question, which is what exactly will count as
contributing to the free software community.  Presumably, this does not
mean _only_ developers, but also people who write documentation, or are
heavily involved in spreading the good word, or volunteer to do the dirty
work behind any organization (setting up tables for a public meeting comes
to mind).  Possibly some kind of record of volunteer hours could be kept
and once someone had exceeded those hours they could go from enthusiast to
significant contributor.  Another possibility is to have a committee
dedicated to membership decisions.  In cases where a dispute arises 
(personal conflicts, probably) a general vote could be requested, and if
a majority vote in favor, that person would go to level 1. (members not
sending in their votes within some specified time would be presumed to 
be voting no, to prevent a large time wastage by frivolous disputes).
   I would also think membership should be subject to renewal.  If a
developer stops working on free software for, say, a year, then s/he's
off level 1.  Same with members who get in by volunteering - they'd
need to keep up their efforts.  After some time, say 5 years, level 1
membership would become permanent, barring some action fundamentally
contrary to the nature of SPI (voted on by 3/4 majority).   Of course,
there are a number of folks who would be grandfathered in now as permanent
members.

  There are other variations on this (perhaps only permanent members
[level 0] could serve on the board?).

   Anyway, I do think there is good reason to have an enthusiast level
membership.  They would be on the [snail] mailing list for promotions and
such as well.  Plus, it's just plain good sense to include your users -
that's one of the reasons free software works so well (I think).

In some sense, we already have this in Debian, with the difference between
users and developers. Not often do I see developers "pull rank" over users.
And I agree with Ian that there is an difference between free software
developers and free softare community members we shouldn't deny.

Agreed. The free software community is larger than the free software
developers though, and I think it is important that members of the free
software community that are not free software developers can participate
to SPI to some degree.

Agreed (for voting membership of contributing members).

I don't think your line of reasoning requires that an "associate membership"
be non-voting. For instance, many democracies have a two-tier voting system.
"associate members" could have the vote in the same way as the British House
of Commons, with "contributing members" acting as a House of Lords: senior
members of the community, that can overrule resolutions approved by the
associate members.

> There seems little point though - what is the purpose of these associate

No. To ensure the participation/representation of the free software
community as a whole in SPI.

I don't think that the issues are distinct. Usually, when there are
distinct "levels" in a governmental organization the distinctive attributes
of those levels are their roles in voting processes. What is the purpose
of separating the membership into these various functional components? I
saw this as an effort to create focused groups of well informed members
that could carry out decisions on particular key areas without requiring
a vote of the complete body of members. I was suggesting the veto action
as a method for integrating the opinion of the larger membership body into
the actions of these smaller groups.

It seems to me that the mechanisms for arriving at consensus (voting, etc.)
are the primary motivator for making functional divisions within
the voting body.

Does that make sense?

Up to this point I agree. I believe that prospective members must show
some proof of participation. Obviously Debian developers have all the
proof that they need, and members of other supported projects as well.

Authorship of a piece of free software should also qualify.

I suspect that it will take some kind of "membership committee" to decide
on the less obvious cases.

I had the same feeling until it dawned on me that associate members are a
path to full membership. If you want to be productive and helpful in the
Free Software community, you become an associate member of SPI where you
can do productive work that will earn you a full membership. Something
like the, each member must do work for SPI at least once a year, clause
that currently exists (I think).

While it isn't clear to me just what "jobs" would be available to these
folks, I think that it is worth considering.

Waiting is,

After studying Apple's new source code license, the APSL, I have
concluded that it falls short of being a free software license.  It
has three fatal flaws, any of which would be sufficient to make the
software less than free.

* Disrespect for privacy.

  The APSL does not allow you to make a modified version and use it for
  your own private purposes, without publishing your changes.

* Central control.

  Anyone who releases (or even uses, other than for R&D) a modified
  version is required to notify one specific organization, which happens
  to be Apple.

* Possibly of revocation at any time.

  The termination clause says that Apple can revoke this license, and
  forbid you to keep using all or some part of the software, any time
  someone makes an accusation of patent or copyright infringement.

  In this way, if Apple declines to fight a questionable patent (or
  one whose applicability to the code at hand is questionable), you
  will not be able to have your own day in court to fight it, because
  you would have to fight Apple's copyright as well.

  Such a termination clause is especially bad for users outside the
  US, since it makes them indirectly vulnerable to the insane US
  patent system and the incompetent US patent office, which ordinarily
  could not touch them in their own countries.

Any one of these flaws makes a license unacceptable.

If these three flaws were solved, the APSL would be a free software
license with three major practical problems, reminiscent of the NPL:

* It is not a true copyleft, because it allows linking with other
files which may be entirely proprietary.

* It is unfair, since it requires you to give Apple rights
to your changes which Apple will not give you for its code.

* It is incompatible with the GNU GPL.

Of course, the major difference between the NPL and the APSL is that
the NPL *is* a free software license.  These problems are significant
in the case of the NPL because the NPL has no fatal flaws.  Would that
the same were true of the APSL.

At a fundamental level, the APSL makes a claim that, if it became
accepted, would stretch copyright powers in a dangerous way: it claims
to be able to set conditions for simply *running* the software.  As I
understand it, copyright law in the US does not permit this, except
when encryption or a license manager is used to enforce the
conditions.  It would be terribly ironic if a failed attempt at making
a free software license resulted in an effective extension of the
range of copyright power.

Aside from this, we must remember that only part of MacOS is being
released under the APSL.  Even if the fatal flaws and practical
problems of the APSL were fixed, even if it were changed into a very
good free software license, that would do no good for the other parts
of MacOS whose source code is not being released at all.  We must
not judge all of a company by just part of what they do.

Overall, I think that Apple's action is an example of the effects of
the year-old "open source" movement: of its plan to appeal to business
with the purely materialistic goal of faster development, while
putting aside the deeper issues of freedom, community, cooperation,
and what kind of society we want to live in.

Apple has grasped perfectly the concept with which "open source" is
promoted, which is "show users the source and they will help you fix
bugs".  What Apple has not grasped--or has dismissed--is the spirit of
free software, which is that we form a community to cooperate on the
commons of software.

Since October 1998, I have been maintaining the website of the League
for Programming Freedom at <http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/>. On this site,
there is an email address where people can write to offer their help.

A number of people have offered to help, but unfortunately there is no
defined agenda for the LPF. The League has no formal organization
right now and I am limiting myself to the role of a webmaster.

I am posting this article here in hopes of starting a discussion among
people who would be interested in forming a steering committee for the
LPF. These people would have to decide what they specifically want to
do to obtain the abolition of software patents by the
U.S. Congress. The LPF also opposes user interface copyrights, but
since a major 1996 U.S. Supreme Court decision, this problem seems to
have receded for now (see the website for details).

The job of the committee would be to define a strategy to eventually
convince Congress of outlawing software patents. Recent news about
Microsoft's patent on style sheets and Sightsound's threats against
MP3.com (regarding patents over downloading audio over a network) may
provide arguments to convince lawmakers that software patents should
be abolished as soon as possible before they become an intolerable
impediment to the software community. A letter-writing campaign might
be a good start; I could post the results on the website.

Greg Aharonian's Internet Patent News Service has published some
issues about the two patents I mentioned:
<http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/patents.html#IPNS>

The front page of the LPF website shows an index to the article
"Against Software Patents", which is a very good read for anyone who
wishes to have a reminder of why software patents are a threat.

i think it is worth pointing out here that the rapid bug-fixing and
development of features is merely a side-effect of this spirit of free
software.  i.e. it is *because* we know that the software is free and can
never be taken away from us, and *because* we know we are contributing to
the common good that we are willing to volunteer our time and energy and
skills to improving free software.

without that security of knowledge, why should we bother? we would be
better off putting our time and energy into something which was truly
free than putting it into something which may be taken away from us in
the future.

free software is, IMO, an example of enlightened self-interest - we
are helping others by helping ourselves, and making an investment in
software "infrastructure" which will benefit us all for decades (or
more) to come.

It's a nightmare.  It looks like it's _mostly_ aimed at limited AT&T's
liability.  At least they included "non-frivolous" with regards to the
patent infringement case...

   I also love how they capitalize YOU everywhere.

I would like to see us get involved with this.

Personally, I am curious to see whether we could bring a class action
suit against the United States government under the arguement that 
software patents, in their current state, violate a Free Software 
programmer's freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is a gauranteed
human right and is supposed to be stronger legally than a patent, which 
is a tool of convenience. I think it is arguable that many programmers
are as dedicated to the creation of Free Software as any religious person
is to their chosen method of worship.

I, personally, cannot reach a solid decision on the Apple license and
would like to bounce some ideas off of you to see if it can solidify
my thinking. It strikes me that the notification clauses, while 
inconvenient, do not render the software proprietary. You still have
complete freedom to modify the code and use it for whatever purpose
you care to. In some ways, depending on Apple's future behavior, this
could be seen as a tool for increasing freedom. If Apple agressively
redistributes the modifications that they are notified of then a very
large amount of software may become publicly available from their
efforts.

The patent clauses are curious and I can see the danger in the fact that
Apple can keep you from ever getting a chance to fight a patent in court.
On the other hand, Apple has granted use of an unknown number of patents
for use in free software. This seems like a good thing. Is your arguement
with the way they have coupled the license issues with the patent issues?
I suppose I can see the danger in that, they have made the copyright an
extension of the patent. Hmmm. ?

    I don't think we need to contest it on 1st amendment grounds.  The
thing is, distributing source code (maybe even binary code) is expression
and can't infringe on a patent.  But what does infringe on the patent is
when the software is actually loaded into the computer and executed, which
then makes the computer an instantiation of the patented device.  In
essence, you "manufacture" an infringing device each time you execute the
program.  
   At least, this is what I've gathered.  The distinction is a technical
one, but it's consistent with the way the courts have ruled between the 
copyrightable parts of software (the actual expression) versus the
patentable parts (the actual functioning).
   I don't know if you could be sued for "contributory infringement",
though.  
   The better grounds for a lawsuit defense (I think) would be to argue
that it's in the public interest to foster free software development.
>From what I've been reading, the courts (particularly the Supreme Court)
consider themselves to be the arbiter of what this is and have 
used it in the past as grounds for revoking patents.  I'm not sure about
the current SC, though.  But Justice O'Connor did make an encouraging
statement in one case that I've seen quoted several times (though of
course I can't find it when I look for it) about how the IP laws exist to
serve the public, not the IP monopolist, and when those two conflict, the
public wins.
   
   I am not a lawyer, I've just taken an active interest in this area,
since it seems to me we have a fundamental interest in making the law work
for us (as opposed to only those who can pay for it).

   Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on Technology?  They have expressed some
interest in Open Source (their choice of words).   I think it would be a
good idea to establish a working relationship with some of these other
groups, at least.

My point is more to the fact that it is nearly impossible for an independant
programmer to find out if they are infringing on a patent. The patent 
database is intractibly large, lacks proper search tools and contains
absurd numbers of patents that are overly broad. What this equates to is
an environment that is uncomfortable, if not openly hostile, to the
independant programmer.

I know HERT once said they had a lawyer willing to help with things like
this. Then again I don't think they ever thought on this kind of scale.

>From the discussions it seems that people favor the two tiered membership  
approach, so here's an initial whack at the bylaws article.

Note that I'm _not_ discussing voting in here... that's the next topic for 
the other bylaws article.  This is _just_ for the details of what 
membership is, and what rights and obligations etc. _other_ than voting it 
entails.

Right now it's written in a chopped up form to make it easier to read... 
as the discussion draws to a close, I'll put it in a more 'readable' 
paragraph form.

IWJ- your points I have considered and included in this mail

Lynn- your points are regarding voting and committee service- both of 
these articles will be discussed later (I already have started rewriting 
the committee one.  Which members can serve where should be defined in 
there.)

Everyone else- thanks for your comments. I've read them all over prior to 
writing this and think I've included most concerns.

Nils.

ps. an aside- let's get this done quickly if possible, then we can get a 
membership and have committees to take care of things like OS and LPF etc. 
 This would take a LOT of strain off the current board members.



General
-------
[this section is for information that applies to all members]

[The membership should/will control SPI, and SPI's board and ultimately
everyone that acts for SPI will be held accountable to the membership. 
--iwj email]
[somehow I'd like to phrase this into a good sentence.  Suggestions? :)]


- There are contributing and non-contributing membership available within 
this organization.  All membership applications will be reviewed by the 
Membership Committee.
[where do we state the complete list of membership criteria?  Here?  In 
the charter for the membership committee?  What should the criteria be?]

- all members agree to the general goals principles of SPI and agree to 
help support the organization.
[This wording is ugly.  Basically, I want to say that members should 
(must?) agree with what SPI stands for and is trying to achieve.]

- members may leave the organization at any time by notifying the 
membership committee of their desire for the membership to be terminated.


Contributing Members
--------------------

- becoming a contributing member
   The applicant must apply for a contributing membership and include a 
list of projects or free software related activities that they have 
participated in (including what they have done) within the last two years 
(more may be included if desired).  This will be reviewed by the 
membership committee.
[should we define more tangible criteria here (or in the membership 
committee charter) or leave it a little open ended?  how significant a 
contribution should it be (point from iwj email)??]

- term of membership
   The contributing membership will expire two years from the date of 
issue of the membership.  It may be renewed.  If it is not renewed, the 
member will be downgraded to a non-contributing member.  To again become a 
contributing member at a later time, the person can simply follow the 
renewal procedure.
[I think 2 years is reasonable, and the downgrading is also a feasible 
idea for handling the memberships.]

- renewal of membership
   The member will be notified one month ahead of time that the membership 
is due to expire and will be asked to send a renewal application with a 
list of projects or free software related activities that they have 
participated in within the last two years.  This will be reviewed by the 
membership committee.
[I like this approach... easily automated too]

- board members
   Board members, by virtue of their office, are automatically 
contributing members.
[board members are working for SPI so by definition are contributing.]


Non-contributing Membership
---------------------------
[this section seems short, but then again, I don't think it should be that 
hard to become a non contributing member.  Look at javalobby.org- all 
members do is basically support the 'write once, run anywhere' concept.  
I'm picturing the same for SPI- non contrib members just support the

- becoming a non-contributing member
   The applicant must apply for a non-contributing membership.  The 
application will be reviewed by the membership committee.

- term of membership
   The membership will not expire.

I'm not totally sure what you're driving at... on the surface, it's obvious
that the membership controls the organization.. ultimatly.  Surely you are
not talking about the day to day business.  Do you want to list member
resposiblities?  Why we have members?  I've tried 7 or 8 suggested sentance
but none fit because I don't know where you want the introduction to lead.
That being said... here's something that seems to fit with the rest of the
letter...

Members are the ultimate controlling body of SPI, Inc.  Although the
day-to-day business is carried out by the Board of Directors and their
committees, the members have the responsibility to oversee the Board and
make sure it functions within the goals and principles of SPI as set forth
in this document (and the root of SPI should be here or in the articles of
Inc.).

That depends on how "fluid" you want the membership requirements to be.
Something defined in the bylaws should be harder to change than something
defined in a "lesser" document.  The way it's harder to change our
constitution than it is the change the Laws of U.S.A.

Members agree to support SPI's goals.  

This give a little out.  "Joe" might not agree 100% with everything (he
doesn't like the GPL because it's a virus in his eyes) but SPI supports it
so he'll also support it, but not use it in his own code.

Why?  Why not "Only contributing members can be board members"  Is the job
of being a board member going to be so full they won't have time to
contribute to another project?

The applicaton must apply for non-contributing membership stating they
support the principles of SPI.

Just for clarity and balance.  Otherwise, it's not needed.

I'd have it expire in 2 years also... basicly a ping to take them off the
email lists if they don't respond...

Well,  it'd be nice to make the distinction that "the _members_ control
SPI",  not "the board controls SPI".  At the moment,  it is (on the
surface) the other way around.

How about just like we do for Debian:

	A member must meet the criteria set forth by the Membership
Committee acting on behalf of the Company.

That way,  the membership requirements can be more flexible.  We could
even set it up so that the membership committee,  in circumstances of
extreme uncertainty,  can thus query the current membership and say "We're
sitting on the fence.  Should 'Joe' be a member?"

Except in the broadest terms, that's for a membership section of this
document.  It's spelled out, maybe in a section that defines the board or a
section that defines voting, *how* the board is controled...

That might work -- it'd be an interesting experiment -- but it's usually
good in the "entity" world (SPI is a legal entity/"person") to have atleast
*some* guidelines so the outside world can look on and see that all is well
(such as policies of non-discrimination, for example)

I think there are two issues here: the requirement to publish changes
and the requirement to notify a specific party.

The requirement to publish changes, even if the changes are not being
used by the public in any way, violates an essential privacy right.

The requirement to notify a specific party when you release a modified
version is perhaps not fatal, but I have a bad feeling about it.

    The patent clauses are curious and I can see the danger in the fact that
    Apple can keep you from ever getting a chance to fight a patent in court.
    On the other hand, Apple has granted use of an unknown number of patents
    for use in free software. This seems like a good thing.

These are two separate actions.  The latter would be a good thing, not
a problem, of course, but the former is a problem.

(Though in fact they have not granted "use in free software" of these
patents, only use in this particular software, whose freeness or not
is the question here.)

Ok,  how about:
	"A person desiring [active/voting] membership must be determined
to have made significant contribution to the Free Software community or to
another activity or project directly relating to the [published] goals and
ideals of SPI.  This determination will be made by the Membership
Committee acting on behalf of the membership of SPI." 

	Then you can put the standard "SPI will not discriminate
on the basis of race, color, age, sex, sexual preference, species or
anything else" clause at the bottom of the whole document.

Actually I oppose it if there is any alternative to be found.  It would
cause the higher tier of membership to become a status symbol.  I think
anyone familiar with my rants about GNOME of late should be well aware
that I feel the GNOME project is doing poorly if their goal is to produce
good software because the people running the project are too busy
building their own egos to actually build anything useful.

As a result GNOME is at any given point half broken, bloated, and
generally unusable if you need something that works now.  I'd rather not
see this happen with SPI, though it may be necessary for the reasons
others have cited.  I'm just very leery about letting any one or any
small group determine if someone's contribution to the community is
"worthy" of being allowed into the upper ranks.  I'm worried this is
likely to push anyone but those who have published and popular code out
of consideration, even if they have done other things that are extremely
important.

Forgive me if my faith in the community is not all that strong in this
regard.  I hear all the time that we need more people to pick up the
non-code areas which are being ignored.  People to write docs and howtos,
people to advocate for Free Software in positive ways, that sort of
thing.  Yet where is the notoriety in these things?  Nobody knows who
these people are and their work is taken for granted.  The more we try to
limit ourselves to the elite, the more it's going to simply become a
popularity contest and the more these people who are probably most
responsible for where we are now are going to be excluded.

Try two, for readability:

The membership shall control SPI and the SPI board.  All who act on SPI's
behalf will untimately be held accountable to the membership.

I would say membership charter.  See above for my concerns as to the
criteria I've heard voiced of "significant contribution to the community"
differenciating the "non-contributing" and the "contributing" members.  I
don't think the criteria for becoming a non-contributing member should be
too discriminative if we're going to have this tier setup.  If it's
reasonable to go with a flat membership and we do so, we'll need to be a

Aren't these spelled out in a mission statement?  Why not simply refer to
that?

I'm really more interested in who decides what is "significant" if we
leave it open ended.  I think perhaps reference to another document might
be good here as well--not so much because of the chance of revision but
because of the likelyhood this will be read over the Internet on a web
page and if we are going to have hyperlinks we may as well use them in a
way which is going to promote readability of the finished product.

I think this is a good idea, actually.  Do you think two years is a good
time length or is one year a better time frame?  Either one is fine with
me.

I think you have the right idea here.

No its not, but it's a little of the same in Debian: the DPL shoudn't 
necessarily have packages.  Remember it's volunteer work here, so I'd like 
to make it easier esp. sine the board members will be putting a fair 
amount of effort into SPI.  Also, I think that there should be an option 
(however small) for non contributing members to become board members.  I 
think this is highly unlikely, but say we need a financial expert on the 
board who hasn't worked with free software before for example.

Then you have to define what happens when a contributing memebr slips into 
non contrib.  I think this way is easy, and really see no need to remove 
inactive supporting members.  Otherwise I'd me for a longer term (4-5 
years possibly).

That should be defined in the membership committee charter.

Two years.  One year rolls around too soon, and I also think that there's 
the potential for someone to take time off from free software work 
(work/personal issues etc.) so I think 2 years is just right.  Keeps the 
workload down on the membership committee too.  Remember- they're 
volunteers.

[Here is the first 'real' cut at writing the article since most people 
seemed to agree with the basic principles.  I think this looks fairly 
good, but I'm sure it could use a little polishing.

--Nils.]


MEMBERSHIP
----------

Membership in this organization shall be open to all who meet the approval 
of the membership committee.  Members have the right and responsibility of 
overseeing the board members, officers, and committees and ensuring that 
they operate in accordance with the goals and principles of the 
organization.  All board members, officers, and committees are ultimately 
responsible to the membership, and should act in accordance with its 
wishes.

Contributing and non-contributing membership are available within 
this organization.  Members agree to help further and support the 
principles and goals of this organization.  All membership applications 
and renewals will be reviewed by the Membership Committee.  Applicants 
must meet the criteria set forth in the charter of the Membership 
Committee.

Members wishing to leave the organization may do so at any time by 
notifying the membership committee of their desire for the membership to 
be terminated.


Contributing Members
--------------------

  To become a contributing member the applicant must apply for a 
contributing membership and include a list of projects or free software 
related activities that they have participated in (and what they 
specifically have done) within the last two years (more may be included if 
desired).

   The contributing membership will expire two years from the date of 
issue of the membership.  The member will be notified one month before the 
expiration of the membership and will be asked to send a renewal 
application with a list of projects or free software related activities 
that they have participated in within the last two years.  If the 
membership is not renewed, the member status will be downgraded to a 
non-contributing member.  To again become a contributing member at a later 
time, the person can simply follow the renewal process.

   Board members, by virtue of their office, are automatically granted the 
status of contributing members.


Non-contributing Membership
---------------------------

 To become a non contributing member, the applicant must apply for a 
non-contributing membership. The membership will not expire.

Perhaps it's time to address the issue of whether we'll have the
(hu)manpower needed to manually reinstate a member every year. I know that
some of this could be automated, but the automation will inevitably
require a responsible, quick-to-reply set of maintainers, in much the same
way as the debian new-maintainer list does.

With the automation, I don't see why it'd be a large problem.  Debian has
functioned pretty well with it's new maintainer team...  SPI, if it has
that big if a membership work load, should also have a larger pool of
volunteers that can be tapped for projects such as this.

You bring up a fundamental problem in volunteer organizations. (This is
what I call "The Little Red Hen" problem.)

In support of removing such problems where possible, I keep returning to
the following questions:

Why should membership have a duration?

Does the value of a contribution deminish over time?

Are we considering any other conditions that would "remove" a member?


I can see no reason, once a person has "qualified" for membership, that we
should ever terminate that membership unless the member specifically
requests such termination.

Why do I think this? The reasoning goes like this:

   1. All of the requirements for membership involve some level of
      contribution to the Free Software Movement.

   2. Once membership is obtained, work done for SPI becomes a
      contribution to the FSM.

   3. Members who make no contribution have their "influence" reduced.


One of the components of the "Corporate Charter" (Which is the DNA of SPI)
is an educational responsibility. I know this sounds like a totally
unrelated issue, but it speaks to the need for more than one "class" of
member. By making "full membership" contingent on a reasonably high level
of commitment to Free Software we keep SPI's goals under the control of
the "right" people. By providing an "associate membership" for the rest of
the world, we provide an educational interface for the uninformed "general
public", as well as an avenue for contribution by individuals and
corporations who would otherwise not qualify for SPI membership.

Waiting is,

Dwarf

How about to just keep the rolls (or atleast the "all important"
contributing member rolls) down to people who are active?  If nobody every
expired, and people just dropped out (it happens a lot) we could end up
with way too many people to satisfy any quorum...  

Just a thought.  I'd have to think if I actually believe it's a real
problem on an imagined one.

> Does the value of a contribution deminish over time?
of course not... but availability does.  If we had a "sure fire" way to
make sure people didn't just "disappear" like happens from time to time
with Debian... either way, it'll be some amount of work for someone(s).
The expiration way is more automatable.

> Are we considering any other conditions that would "remove" a member?
Violation of the goals and such of SPI, I suppose.. but that could be
specified in the Membership Committee Charter...

Isn't one month a bit short? I'ld rather see that extended to 3 months.

Also, you list two types of membership here, but don't say what their
difference will be. Can I assume that will be determined by other
sections of the bylaws?

I was interested in 

"I guess we are finding out that there are many open
source spokesmen, but Eric owns the Open Source Initiative trademark"

Now, is there such a thing as the OSI(tm) or is he refering to the OS(tm) and
if so, shouldn't SPI at least contradict this?

Wondering,
Luis.

AFAICT there is no such thing as the OSI(tm), only the OS(tm) and SPI is 
the owner of that and it it being managed by OSI at present.  
www.uspto.gov can verify this- just do a search for Open Source.

The only two listed are SPI's "Open Source" and OSS.NET,  which is "Open

I had never understood the right to privacy to be a goal of Free Software
licensing. The GPL, in fact, arguably removes the right to keep personal
coding techniques private.

Agreed. Still, are we saying that this is "not fatal" in the sense that
a license with this property is still Free Software?

So, then perhaps the requirement to make your code available publicly if used
for commercial purposes is ok but the termination of copyright due to patent
litigation is not.

I agree that this is a "bug" in their license. But this touches on the 
larger and more complex matter of "Free" but incompatible licenses. As
the GPL demonstrates, limiting the use of your intellectual property to 
a particular sphere of other licensed material is apparently fair play.

You realize, of course, that with a membership of 50,000 (which I consider
conservative) we would probably end up authenticating some 2,000 renewals
per month. I have grave concerns regarding our ability to create a 
membership infrastructure that is able to actually assess the participation
of potential members in various free software projects. Perhaps some sort
of "vouching scheme" would be possible, but is obviously fairly easily
defeated.

Just curious, is it intentional that Eric Raymond is still listed as
managing the 'Open Source' trademark? If so, why? He is clearly not fit to
be managing it with the whole APSL mess going on.

Also, does SPI have any intentions of enforcing the trademark wrt to Apple
using it to endorse their APSL license?

Thanks,

    I had never understood the right to privacy to be a goal of Free Software
    licensing.

It was one of my goals in designing the GPL.

	       The GPL, in fact, arguably removes the right to keep personal
    coding techniques private.

I would not say that.

    So, then perhaps the requirement to make your code available publicly if used
    for commercial purposes is ok but the termination of copyright due to patent
    litigation is not.

You have misinterpreted my words; that is not what I intended to say.

Ordinarily I would try to explain what I did intend to say, but I am
getting frustrated with your tendency to misunderstand things I have
said, and throw your misunderstandings back at me aggressively.  If
you are going to misunderstand no matter what I do, I may as well
minimize the time I spend explaining.

Keeping up with "active" members is much easier than deciding whether or
not they have met "qualification requirements" for each year they "claim"
membership.

I simple membership list ping, before meetings, would determine who was
active and who wasn't. If they can be reached, they should still have the
opportunity to vote.

But if they "just disapear", so what? 

I had the impression that the increased management of members was intended
to make sure that all participants were "qualified" in some way, and not
just casual (or malicious) interlopers with a mistaken interest in the
organization.

Once you "qualify" as a member, your active participation is a positive
thing, but I don't see that your, possibly temporary, lack of
participation indicates a "drag" on SPI resourses that must be rectified
by removal of the non-participant member.

Until a member doesn't want their name on the membership rolls, I see no
reason to remove them.

As with Debian, I see no reason to go beyond gaining assurances at the
beginning that the applicant does, in fact, agree with the principles of
the organization. I have participated in "discussions" with other Debian
developers where my belief in the principles of Free Software became
questioned because of a position I took in opposition to the PC one being
promoted. I would hate to fear expulsion for displaying unpopular ideas in
an SPI member forum.

If we do not allow deviations from the pre-defined course of SPI, then the
ship will only go in one direction, and can never be changed. This would
be a drastic mistake from my POV.

That's okay.  Most of my response are intended to get people to think.  I

I'm thinking of voting and such...

Lets say we have 1000 people on the roles but, because of people
disappearing we have only 100 active people... or 100 active people who
will vote on any given issue, anyway.  Given Debian's voting rules, any
single choice would have to get 48 MORE votes than any other choice...

Otherwise the issue is unresolved.

Ah! Now I understand ;-)

Well, I thought that voting was TBD, and was, for the sake of argument,
being left 'til later. (I'm not sure that I completely agree with this,
but it has made the discussion easier so far)

This assumes that SPI will "naturally" adopt Debian's voting rules.

Given the broad membership that SPI is expected to acquire, a direct
democracy would be quite inefficient for "getting the job done".

Think of SPI as a "representative democracy", where the membership votes
for its representative, in the form of the board, and those
representatives actually "decide" on the particulars of what SPI is
"about". With adequate checks and balances, this produces a system that
has both the ability to decide in a hurry, coupled with the capability of
long involved contemplation of those decissions and actions.

But it seems that I too, have digressed into the issues of voting, rather
than staying with the question of who should be a member.

One last off-topic-comment: Before each vote, "active" members would be
asked to register for the vote. The number of registered voters would then
determine what "majority" or "super majority" would mean in this
particular vote.

Under normal voting conditions, you know when you have a yes vote, and you
know when you have a no vote, but when you recieve no vote at all, you
don't know whether it is from the voter being unwilling to vote one way or
the other, or the voter is unable to render a vote at all. As those who
are unable to render a vote, will also be unable to render a reply to the
call for registration, the last group is more clearly identified as
abstaining voters.

Just my POV,

Dwarf

It is.. but it's hard to forget about things like that, totally.  I resort
to not talking about what *should* the quorum be and such.

Not really.  It was just a real world example.  If there was a, say, 25%
quorum, that means 250 more votes.  If there was a 10%, that's 100 votes.
Any "realistic" quorum could be a problem.  Infact, any measurements taken
on "number of members" could be a problem.  This would be in issue to even
vote in the board if that was the only vote members were allowed to make
(like it is in many stockholders meetings).

That would eliminate the need to remove inactive members from the roll..
but it would seem easier to send a ping message out, automaticly, every two
years and anyone who doesn't reply is moved out of the rolls (say, to the
non-contrib rolls or a third class could be inactive-contrib).  Automated,
it could even be sent only if you don't have an email coming from you in
the archives for the last 12 months or something.

Or have ABSTAIN as one of the options that can be voted on...

If the potential members here would not mind "registering" to vote before
each vote, then the only object I'd have to not expiring is taken care of.

[Second cut.  
-Some spelling fixes, changes to 'contrib member requirements' 
(simplified, details can go in charter)
- took out the membership time frame (good point, Ean..)- we'll specify 
that in the membership committee charter.  I'm trying to make is so the 
bylaws only need to be edited in extreme circumstances.

I like it in this form, and unless someone has objections/changes to 
voice, would like to leave this and move on to the COMMITTEE section (we 
can again discuss this when it's time to move all the articles into the 
bylaws...).  I think that working on that section before working on the 
voting will give us a better picture of the voting itself as I think the 
committees will play a large part in helping run SPI.

MEMBERSHIP
----------

Membership in this organization shall be open to all who meet the approval 
of the membership committee.  Members have the right and responsibility of 
overseeing the board members, officers, and committees and ensuring that 
they operate in accordance with the goals and principles of the 
organization.  All board members, officers, and committees are ultimately 
responsible to the membership, and should act in accordance with its 
wishes.

  Contributing and non-contributing memberships are available within 
this organization.  Members agree to support the principles and help 
further the goals of this organization.  All membership applications and 
renewals will be reviewed by the Membership Committee.  Applicants must 
meet the criteria set forth in the charter of the Membership Committee.

Members wishing to leave the organization may do so at any time by 
notifying the membership committee of their desire for the membership to 
be terminated.


Contributing Members
--------------------

  To become a contributing member the applicant must apply for a 
contributing membership and include a list of contributions made to the 
free software community.

   The contributing membership will expire as specified in the membership 
committee charter.  The member will be notified before the expiration of 
the membership and will be asked to send a renewal application with a list 
of projects or free software related activities that they have 
participated in within the previous membership term.  If the membership is 
not renewed, the member status will be downgraded to a non-contributing 
member.  To again become a contributing member at a later time, the member 
can simply follow the renewal process.

   Board members, by virtue of their office, are automatically granted the 
status of contributing members.


Non-contributing Membership
---------------------------

 To become a non contributing member, the applicant must apply for a 
non-contributing membership.  This membership will not expire.

This is the beginning of the discussion for the committee article of the 
bylaws.  Here are some basic principles which I feel should apply to the 
committees.

- they should take care of most of the day to day operation of SPI
  [this takes the workload off the BOD]
- their rights and responsibilities should be completely described in 
their charter
- they should be governed by the board of directors
  [what does this really mean?  I'm not sure yet... but that's who they 
should 'report' to]
- the BOD should be able to issue charters (i.e. create committees)
  [I'm thinking that if the consensus is that a new committee is needed, 
the BOD can issue a charter.  The membership should definitely have some 
input here though. how? By helping write the charter.]


QUESTIONS:
----------
- how are leaders appointed?  I'd say by the BOD, possibly the membership.
- how are members appointed?  BOD?  Leader?  Membership?
- should non-contributing members be able to serve on committees? 
[incidentally, that would automatically make them contributing 
members...!!]
- what do we do if a committee is no longer necessary?  disband it.  How? 
BOD vote?


I'm sure there are other issues here that I'm not addressing... please 
bring them up if you think of them!  As I think you can see, this 
discussion is one step closer to the voting discussion, as this will bring 
up a lot of issues regarding who controls what and why. I think that when 
we're done with this discussion, the voting discussion will be a lot 
easier because the political infrastructure will be in place.

Enjoy...
Nils.

I would rather favor having individuals making those decisions. Committees
are useful if you want to slow down any possible dangerous decisions or 
if power needs to be controller but Committees are not useful for day to
day operations. I would like this to be as non-political as possible. So
far we have had a pretty informal structure and it worked mostly.

Could we make all of this as simple as possible? This looks more and more
to me as if we are building a big administrative apparatus.

I would like to see a list of jobs for individuals within SPI and then a
responsibility to the BOD.

A lot of people have been saying this and I am now taking it upon myself
to make as official a proposal as I possibly can.  Yes, it's long. 
If you want to flame me for the length, do it in private (this means you
Branden...  =>)

I formally propose that SPI step in and take control of its intellectual
property.  At the moment OSI does seem to retain the privilege outlined
above even though the SPI board and most of those in SPI's affiliated
projects seem very unhappy with OSI's management.

So far I can name two such instances in which non-free licenses are being
called Open Source.  The first is Apple's license, which has been
discussed to death by now I'm certain.  OSI has directly claimed this
license to be Open Source---something which not only SPI but Debian and
Bruce Perens as well say does not meet the letter of the Open Source
Definition, much less the spirit.

The other real recent example may or may not have been directly endorsed
by OSI---I don't know for certain.  The bitkeeper license is NOT Open
Source, het it has been called such.  OSI should have by this time done
something about this.  If they have, I can't find anything about it.


And, as we know in the case of Apple's license, Eric Raymond has
responded to the joint statement issued by SPI, Debian, and Bruce
essentially saying it was his opinion that the Apple license was Open
Source and that was that.  Supposedly anything that was Open Source was
suitable for Debian's main distribution because of the direct
relationship between the Debian Free Software Guidelines and the Open
Source Definition.  The Apple license is the first major case in which
a license has been declared Open Source which fails the DFSG.


The story could end there, but it need not.  SPI still owns the Open
Source service mark.  OSI has been given authority to manage the mark.  I
propose SPI revoke that permission and send a cease and desist letter to
OSI immediately.  If OSI is not willing to accept the Open Source
Definition and the oppinions of a large number (perhaps even a large
majority) of the community when making its determination, then obviously
neither of these things truly matter to them.

I propose we stop this madness right now, once and for all.  Eric Raymond
didn't invent Free Software, he didn't even invent the suit-friendly
label for it "Open Source".  He did CatB and got a fair amount of support
for the paper.  My opinion (purely my own but shared by more than a
couple I am certain) is that Eric has let his ego guide his actions of
late.  My signature (I swear this thing is psychic!) demonstrates the
problem clearly.  Eric is more interested in software that doesn't suck
than the Free Software principles of the Open Source Definition.

Eric has indicated he wants to go back to his family and normal life. 
Family is important.  It's clear to me after reading a short comment from
Bruce (uncharacteristically short!  *ducks*) and thinking about it
overnight that he's right.  This job Eric has been trying to fill is too
big for one person to handle on their own.  Let's take the burden off his
back and distribute it evenly among those we believe will represent us
best.  Preferably these people should understand both companies' need to
profit and willingness to support Open Source IFF it is profitable and
the needs of the community to have quality Free Software.

True. We should do that for Debian as well, but I'm not in a hurry
there since Debian already works fine.

Help writing the chapter and of course being able to revoke the creation
of a new committee via a vote.

Have people from the membership volunteer and let the BOD make the final
choice I think.

Another quite common option is to select a leader and let him choose the
rest of the committee if you're forming a new committee. If a current
leader is replace a new leader is chosen by the BOD and the current
committee, with advise from the leaving leader.

I think a committee should have to disband itself.

That depends on their size and internal organization. For example
the ftpmaster team for Debian basically is a committee and they appear
to do very useful day to day operations ..

We are going to need the politics at a certain point anyway; see what
happened to Debian. Without the constitution which has the same amount
of politics things would get (be?) messy.

Umm. They dont work as a committee. And even their disagreements spoil
over to debian-private. Anyways maybe we can frame it in the form of a
committee with a chairman able to do and delegate things. I talked with
Nils on irc about that. I just dont want the common committee nature which
I have seen. It will make swift action impossible. Such a committee for
daily operations is deadly for an organization.

This is a double edged sword. Too much regulation can cause a mess as
well.

I see a committee as a group of people with a certain task and a single
leader. How they organize themselves is entirely up to the committee
itself. Different committees will probably warrant different structures.

Having them and having to use them all the time are different things.
Or do you think that the constitution is hindering or regulating
too much in Debian?

In fact, any decision of the BOD or any committee should be overridable by
a vote of the membership.. but the process should be made troublesome
enough that every person with a hair on their pimple can't contest
everything.

Another possibility is to let the people volunteer for the committee and
let the committee choose the head....

No, it should be able to be disbanded by the BOD, also.  They're the ones
who created it... even if it was at the direction of the membership. =20

pretty informal works for an informal group like a Free Software project.
However, SPI is a legal entity and needs more structure, if for no other
reason, to protect itself.

It doesn't have to be overly complicated, either, just "clear" (quotes
because clear means in the eyes of various regulatory bodies).  Still,
some formality is necessary or clarity.

There's noting "administrative" in what's been done yet... 'cept somehow a
membership roll (well, two) has to be kept...  Committees.  Having
committees doesn't make it administrative.  It might slow things down.. and
it might be necessary to build a safeguard against that (teams, instead of
committees where speed is important).. but it is a necessity to define
what's going to take place...

We are talking about bylaws. Bylaws can be decided upon by the
governing body. This is not the constitution.

How would the membership delegate those things? Election?

How about a petition scheme. If a petition is pgp signed by 10% of the
membership then a vote will be taken which can override any decision of
leadership?

That depends on the situation I would think but we need to have some kind
of governing structure that approves these things. Hopefully simple.

It would be dangerous if the technical oversight committee disbanded
itself. Depends on the committee. Keep it flexible.

Problem is "committee" could mean either "group of people charged with
a task" (similar to what Debian does with d-admin, webmaster,
ftpmaster roles) or "group of bureaucrats who have to have a formal
vote to accomplish anything" (which is how the SPI Board currently
operates).

If these committes are to perform any major function, we can only hope
they act more like task forces than real committees.  :-)

I'd prefer a seconds approach, personally.  Maybe 10% of the body "seconds"
it... but 10% of the people have to sign?  100+ signatures on one document?
Maybe I'm misunderstanding you...

The BOD accepts and appoints the committee members... no approval necessary
for them choosing their own leader.

yes. 100+ signatures on one document in order to get a vote by all
members on an issue. Basically to reverse a decision of the leadership in
sticky situations. maybe we can make it less than 10%?

 ... but the fact that IDC is actually saying that they _knowingly_

 me the creeps.

Yes, simplicity is definitely a goal, but you have to leave room for the 
organization to grow and mature, so a certain complexity is needed.

  Here I disagree a little (we had this discussion on IRC, I'm repeating 
here for everyone elses benefit).  It may be easier with individuals, but 
I think you need a committee so that there is always someone else who can 
also do the work.  Off course the committees should be more or less 
reactive, depending on what they are in charge of.  This is left up to 
their charters I think...

I spoke with Larry McVoy on the phone yesterday, it's very clear that he
is _not_ promoting the license as Open Source, and OSI is not accepting it
as such.

    What a little more disturbing was seeing ESR asked in an interview
about the "New Copyleft" license.  He said it might be time to rethink the
Open Source Definition to include such a beast.  I wish I had the
reference.
   Anyway, I think this kind of statement bodes very badly for the
OpenSource trademark, if SPI doesn't assert its ownership of the mark.

   This is not to say I think ESR is evil.  I have been very disturbed to
see some of the comments on slashdot, and in articles, regarding this
division over the Open Source tm.  Frankly, the subtext of ESR's
announcements always seem to indicate that he's really for free software,
but sees gaining market share (and attracting commercial companies) is the
only realistic way to gain the mind share of the public and demarginalize
the issue.  In a very real way he's correct - any time you want to take a
radical position and make it more acceptable, you have to move the middle
ground in that direction.  Also, I agree with his analysis of the benefits
of making the source available, even if its not free, because it does
benefit the people who, for one reason or another, feel they must use that
platform.  So, in general, I see any move toward more liberal licensing of
code as progress towards the overall goal of free software.

   That said, I also believe the purpose of the Open Source trademark
should not so much be to help advertise products as to inform the consumer
as to the status of the license.  This is especially important in light of
all the various licenses that have been proliferating lately.  In this
regard, I believe the branding body (whether OSI, or a committee of SPI)
should play a role analagous to Consumer Reports, though it does allow the
use of the "rating" in advertising.  Perhaps we should consider "levels"
of Open Source, rather than a simple binary switch.  Then would could
these levels to indicate where in the spectrum a license falls, so the
developer wouldn't have to read the license looking for tricky legalese.
Actually, "levels" might not be quite right either, as the classification
might not be strictly hierarchical, but it would be a start.

A few reorganizations, additions and clarifications.  Please comment on it, 
esp. on the few items left in the question section.  Hopefully we can finish 
this by the middle of next week.  Then it's on to voting!

Nils.


COMMITTEES
----------

- Committees are an extension of the BOD and they should take care of most 
of the day to day operation of SPI

- committees should perform ongoing functions and should not be formed to 
accomplish short term tasks

- they should be governed by the BOD, meaning they report to the BOD, and 
the BOD can override their decisions (if necessary- this should be an 
extreme case)

- they are accountable to the BOD and the membership

- if a committee is no longer necessary it should be disbanded.  This can be 
done by the BOD or a vote of the membership.

- committees can propose resolutions and motions


Charter
-------
- their charter should completely describe their rights and responsibilities 
- the BOD issues and revoke charters (i.e. create and disband committees).  
The membership should help write the charter.
 

Leadership and Membership
-------------------------
- the BOD appoints the committee leadership (leaders and alternates)


QUESTIONS:
----------
- how are members appointed?  BOD?  Leaders?  Membership?  Actually, should 
the committee have an official membership?  The membership of a committee 
should be 'slow moving' i.e. committees should not have a 'revolving door' 
membership with a quick turnover.  How do we accomplish this?

- should non-contributing members be able to serve on committees? 
[incidentally, that would automatically make them contributing 
members...!!  I would say no, as I envision committees doing the more 
'important' work and to be a member you should have done some free software 
work already.  Off course, they can help with committee work, just not be a 
member.  That in turn would qualify them for contributing membership 
eventually.]

- what should the internal structure of the committee look like? how are 
decisions reached within a committee?  Voting?  Consensus?  Should there be 
a general specification for this, or should this be left up to the charter?  
[I'd say leave it up to the charter.  The membership committee and 
administrative committee should be a lot more reactive, and (for example) an 
Open Source committee or other more politically oriented committees should 
be more slow moving and stable.]

Day to day operations are short term tasks and require ongoing decision
making. Maybe I am confused here about the nature of committees.

committees are formed around an issue. This could be by members sharing a
certain interest or by the BOD organizing a committee or appointing
someone to start a committee. Powers to make decisions are conferred to
the committee by the BOD. Unless a committee has the power to make
decisions in a certain they can only submit recommendations
to the BOD.

Of course

Maybe leave that up to the committee. The chairman needs to be responsible
for the actions to the BOD to have accountability.

Hi,

For those who haven't seen it, http://www.opencode.org.

Seems to be a project by law students and "internet activists" to get end
users involved in free software, support free software development, and 
work on free software advocacy. I don't know anything about it beyond the
web site, so add a grain of salt, but it looks cool.

The problem is that these guys are not free software developers, and may
not represent our interests. On the other hand, the essay on that site
shows that their heart is in the right place, it appears that they have
good legal/academic/lobbyist connections, and IMO involving end users in
this way is a 200% more exciting goal than getting yet another big
corporation to donate some token code. (My free software work has been on
the Debian Tutorial and Gnome, so clearly their goals and mine are
similar. :-)

I would like to see SPI the developer's organization work very closely
with them. I'd like to see them contributing to Debian; to achieve their
goals they need a 100% free operating system, and Debian is the only one
right now.

SPI needs people to do outreach, advocacy, lobbying, finance, legal stuff.
They need people to write code, and they need free software "street cred."
Could be a great pairing.

They are also not yet organized and their goals aren't set in stone;
there's some sort of online meeting on May 20, and SPI members should be
there pushing for something like the Social Contract and advocating
developer's interests. Maybe the H2O people can even become a part of SPI
instead of starting their own group. Anyway, I plan to get involved with
this if I can and I hope others will give it some thought too.

Thanks,
Havoc

What sort of vote?  Quorum,  two-thirds?

> Actually, should the committee have an official membership? 
Yes.  If a comittee is going to "be responsible for the day-to-day running
of SPI" (i.e.,  they're going to make day-to-day descisions on behalf of
the company),  we may eventually end up in legal trouble if there's no one
who is officially responsible.

> - should non-contributing members be able to serve on committees? 
> - what should the internal structure of the committee look like?
On the same tack,  should committees be required to hold discussion on
publically-available lists?  I understand that in some cases this simply
isn't an option,  but in many cases it might be best if all committee
discussions were done in front of the world.  Maybe a list for the
committee which only the committee can send to,  but everybody can read?

Why?  Why can the BOD not form a "team" to work with apple on developing an
Open Source license?  Once the license is done, the "team" (I like team
better than committee) is not needed and can be disbanded, naturally.  It
could even be written into the charter in such a way that it wouldn't take
a seperate action by the BOD to disband.  (But still satisfy the BOD
disbanding it).

> - committees can propose resolutions and motions
either "within the scope of their charter" or "of the type specified in
their charter" or "if allowed in their charter"... A committee on the OS
trademark shouldn't have any power to propose on an issue involving
membership.  The individual members will still have what ever powers the
bylaws give, but not the "team" as an "entity".

> Leadership and Membership

Structure should be left up to the charter.  Maybe (can't think of one off
the top of my head but maybe) a leader isn't necessary or even harmful to
the Foobard team... so they shouldn't have one.  Instead, the whole team
should be appointed by the BOD -- esp. since the "teams" are an extention
of the BOD.  If a leader is needed, the how the leader comes to be can be
spelled in the charter (in theory, some leaders can then be appointed by
the BOD, elected by the membership or chosen by the committee members).

see above.  I"m not sure "turnover" can be measured except by very careful
selection of the "team" members.

Try to think of ALL the possible types of committees... then find the

That is all that should be in the bylaws.  The rest should be in the
charters.

Agreed, they need to get a handle on things.  At this point I think "by
any means necessary" is required, but I guess SPI seems to be more
interested in trying to resolve this peacefully if they can.

You'll forgive me for being pessimistic and cynnical about it and saying
I'll believe that will achieve the desired results when I see them.

The problem is, there's only so far that it's safe to go..  Corporations
want him to go further and some corporations supposedly "on our side"
(but whom I really believe aren't at all on "our side") are helping push
him that way.  The problem I'm seeing is that he's doing what they want. 
I don't think he realizes even.

Interesting thoughts..  A page for licenses determined to be Open Source
that talks about the restrictions they have might be a good idea.  I
don't think a "rating system" is a good idea as came to mind when I read
the words.  We don't need to score licenses on how cool they are.  But a
set of yes/no questions about the licenses would be good.  Someone did
something like that I think.

Then count me as one against.

SPI currently does not have any formal membership policies, or any means
for anyone but its board to control it.

SPI does not have a history of fast and effective action -- we're still
waiting for publication of all the comments it requested about who should
control the open source mark, and we still haven't made any decision on
that. At present we can't even say "yes" to an open source project that
asks us for CVS space.

SPI does not have a history of effective advocacy of free software to
business or the masses.

In short, I don't think SPI is well placed to do OSI's job, let alone do
it better.

Further, OSI is making efforts in the right direction. They are discussing
how the APSL should be improved with Apple, and they've now published a
list of board members. Sure. They're still a way off being open enough
themselves, but this isn't the way to go about improving matters.

Cheers,
aj

Say what? All public disclosure from OSI indicates that they are dragging
their feet about any change in the APSL, nor has anyone at Apple indicated
that OSI is working on this.

I'm sure most people by now have had a chance to read the article by Bruce 
regarding software patents... one of the concepts he brings up is an 
organization to work for the community in helping with patent related 
issues.  SPI is mentioned as one of the possibilities, FSF as another.  What 
do people think of this idea, and how should the problem in general be 
approached?

I agree with Bruce, and I think SPI would be an excellent vehicle for
this.

We need to firm up our position on IPR we hold, and publish a
statement about what the rules will be for such patents, and then we
should post an announcement requesting that free software developers
who have had what they think might be patentable ideas contact us.

Ian.

I'm very interested in joining SPI as a member. What is the process for
doing so? I am currently a registered debian developer, and i understand
that it was formerly the case that all debian developers were (by virtue
of such position) members of SPI. If this is no longer the case, does
anyone know the application procedure?

We have a problem with Harmony. One of the earlier authors
is getting worried about possible legal action. I don't think
he has anything to fear, but he has asked us to replace his
sources.

Would he still be legally responsible if he transferred all
rights to another party? If we can guarantee his safety he
has agreed to let us use his sources.

Is it possible for SPI to serve as a legal umbrella for the
new Harmony project? I do not fear a lawsuit, but just in case.

As they say, the only person who can safely be appointed to a position
of power is the one who doesn't want that honour.

Richard Stallman isn't interested in the label "Open Software" in the
slightest (as he has made very clear), so the FSF would make a good,
neutral custodian for the trademark on behalf of all those wishing to
use it. There is no way it would be abused to feather the FSF's own
nest, a definite danger elsewhere.

SPI, OSI (not a good choice of name!) and any number of other OSS
organizations can perform their roles perfectly adequately without
holding the trademark themselves. In fact, it would be a bad idea if
one of them were to hold it in an exclusive manner, since this would
then make other similar organizations operate in some sense as second
class citizens, ie. in a subsidiary capacity. That would not be
even-handed, and it's easy to see much bad feeling developing from
such a skewed setup --- we see the start of that already.

In contrast, in the FSF it would in effect lie in a sort of
undisturbed "glass case", a place of esteem for the latest emblem of
the community. I think this would work well.

I understand this sentiment, but I don't agree with it in this case. As the
events of this year have shown, "Open Source" works well as a marketing tool
for free software, and does not, when properly managed (including, when
needed, defended) weaken the politics of free software.

(Also, to some extent, the fact that SPI has chosen to consult the free
software community in the trademark issue, is an argument for it not being
in the "game" for power's sake).

There's more to the trademark than use: there is also the issue of defending
the trademark. Would the FSF be willing to sue (and thus potentially commit
a lot of money) to defend a trademark it isn't interested in?
Also, when Open Source is held by the FSF, how would the definition of the
term be managed (it is to some degree desirable to be able to modify the
definition in the future, to clarify aspects unaddressed so far, and follow
the collective opinion of the free software community)?

Hi,

since we're hosting more and more mailing lists for several projects
I'd like to create a new hostname for them.  If the supported project
provides their own hostname (like berlin-consortium.org or
zinc.rulez.org) we can use this domain without a major problem.

If the project doesn't provide a hostname of their own we currently
use other.debian.org as hostname.  I would like to use a different
one.  Canonical I could install other.spi-inc.org however I also
consider projects.spi-inc.org.

I'm open to good ideas.

Regards,

	Joey

anything from a very small single purpose program, to an entire environment

underway I'd love to hear about it, if not, please email me and maybe we
can start one.

[Background, for those not on the Debian lists: Ian has made a controversial
proposal ("DFSG2") for a new version of the Debian Free Software Guidelines,
which would make some software that's currently considered free, considered
non-free.]

IMO, this depends a lot on who controls / ends up controlling the Open
Source Definition. If it's SPI, it's not unthinkable to me that there'll be
updated versions of the OSD, which could might track at least some of the
changes in the DFSG. While this doesn't exclude the possibility of two
standards, in this scenario the gap between them might well be small. 

Open Source's purpose was to be a marketing tool for free software. Having
the DFSG and the OSD diverge would make Open Source a lot less useful from
my perspective.

   It was the _League for Programming Freedom_. Their web site,

AFAIK the LPF never had www.lpf.org.  At any rate, the current website

A short while ago I sent a response to the "consultation" announcement.  I would like to apologize to Dale Scheetz 

for the implications I made in that mail, and ask his forgiveness for I was simply wrong.  Dale is of outstanding 

character and I never should have questioned that.  If you've not read that message, don't bother.  It added no value 

to the discussion anyway.  Having mistaken him for one of the bad guys, he has been kind and gracious in 

explaining how I was mistaken and I thank him for it.  I don't mean to waste bandwitdth with this stuff, but it was 

important to me to send this.  Thanks.

According to http://www.spi-inc.org/news/1998/19981124 :

I have seen no responses made public yet, nor any statement from SPI
regarding the "Open Source" trademark situation, nor any indication if (and
if so, how) the trademark situation is affected by Bruce Perens' statement
regarding his resignation from OSI (widely publicised and discussed in free
software news media, e.g.
http://slashdot.org/articles/99/02/18/0927202.shtml), in which he accuses
OSI (and Eric Raymond in particular) of having lost the free software focus,
and hints at unconscionable abuse of the Open Source mark.

The opensource.org domain still has "Software in the Public Interest" as its
registrant, and http://www.spi-inc.org/trademarks still says "The Open
Source trademark is managed by Eric Raymond on behalf of the free software
community". However, http://www.opensource.org/osi-launch.html still claims
SPI transfered the "Open Source" mark to Eric Raymond and that OSI's
"mission will be to own and defend the Open Source trademark, [...]".

In short, the "Open Source" trademark situation is still a mess, and there's
a distinct possibility of it getting even messier, and I've seen no signs of
activity by SPI to untangle this mess since the announcement I quoted
earlier.

Needless to say, I find this extremely disappointing. I can only express my
(unfortunately increasingly dwindling) hope that SPI will act now, and act
in an open fashion to resolve this issue.

Agree, agree, agree, in general.

Having been subscribed to the SPI board list for some time I think the 
problems center around:

- The board being generally too busy with personal matters to draft or
  decide action on the mark.

- A general hesitance to piss ESR or OSI in general off.

I think that getting more people involved would help raise confidence
in taking independant action and would create more calories of human
energy to attack these problems with.

The announced "Consultation about the Open Source trademark", posted
on Nov 24 1998, states:

    The consultation period will end at midnight at the end of the
    calendar year 1998, UTC. All consultation responses will be made
    public by SPI after the consultation period has closed, unless the
    respondent specifically requests otherwise.

Being well after new-year, I believe time has come to clean up this
mess one way or another.  It does seem like SPI can expect solid
support for its position - at least if the only other alternative is
to legally transfer the mark to OSI.

Here's a resolution I'm working on to address concerns about who has 
control of what equipment etc.  Please comment on this, and feel free to 
propose additions, changes, etc.  I would like this resolution to address 
all relevant issues that may come up with donations or loans of equipment 
and services, but also want to keep the resolution general.

Nils.


---------------------------------------------------------------
-Proposed Draft- Resolution 1999.03.03.nl
Guidelines for Equipment and Service Donations
---------------------------------------------------------------


General Guidelines for Donations
--------------------------------

- All equipment and services donated to SPI or any of its affiliated 
projects must be used in compliance with any and all applicable laws

- All equipment will be used to further the goals of SPI and its 
affiliated projects, and will be used in accordance with all SPI rules and 
regulations.

- The criteria for differentiating between donated and loaned equipment 
shall be whether or not a transfer of ownership from the donor to SPI has 
taken place.


Equipment Guidelines
--------------------

- Donations of equipment can be marked for a specific project, or for SPI 
in general.  The latter is preferred as it allows SPI more flexibility in 
the usage of equipment.

- Equipment can be donated for a specific purpose.  SPI will make every 
attempt to use it for the specified purpose, but may at its discretion 
(and the discretion of the project that it was earmarked for, if 
applicable) change its use if this is deemed necessary.

- Equipment that is on loan to SPI or an affiliated project will be 
considered a service, and will be used under the service guidelines.


Service Guidelines
------------------

- Any restrictions on donations or their usage must be stated at the time 
of donation.

- If the donor wishes to change the conditions under which the service is 
donated or withdraw the service, he must inform SPI (and the project that 
the service is donated to, if applicable) 15 days in advance.

- If SPI (or the project that the service is donated to, if applicable) 
wishes to change the usage of the service, or use the service in a manner 
contrary to that initially specified, they must inform the provider of the 
service 15 days in advance.

This is a good start but fails to address some of the fundamental issues.

The language about donated -vs- loaned equipment is useful but is somewhat
a given considering the default laws surrounding bill of sale and transfer
of ownership.

I think one of the most important issues is what "donated for SPI usage"
entails. I would think something along these lines would be useful:

- Services and equipment which are donated to SPI for general use will 
be utilized only for projects which are officially affiliated with SPI.
Any special utilization of donated services or equipment for projects
that are not officially affiliated will be subject to the permission
of the donor and the rules spelled out in the "Support in Temporary,
Emergency or Other Unusual Circumstances" section.

The "Support in Temporary, Emergency or Other Unusual Circumstances"
section should specify clearly the situations which warrant the use
of SPI resources outside the typical project support guidelines and
the reasons that warrant such utilization. The key being that SPI
"support" should typically be going to officially supported projects.
I can see that there should be policy for facilitating responsiveness
in quick-turn situations such as the LDP issue but these situations
should be the exception and not the rule. It should also be insured
that projects are not allowed to remain in this limbo state and are
moved into an officially supported position or are removed.

I can try to work on a clearer Temporary / Emergency section. Perhaps
we should set up CVS to manage these documents? Does that seem
useful?

Yeah, but I figured a definition can't hurt, might help get rid of some 
confusion sometime.

Hmmm... that would make a lot of things tougher, hosting of a mailing 
list, offering some FTP space, at this point you're tying SPI and the 
projects down in terms of their reactivity.  I'd suggest not putting this, 
but rather something along the lines of 'within the SPI goals' to leave it 
general.  Plus you said donated- if equipment is donated it's SPI's and 
the donor has no say, if it's a service/loan, then that could apply.  But 
I'd still rather leave his resolution general and ask the donor to put 
that clause into the service agreement at the start of the loan- makes 
thing easier on all parties I think.

Not sure I agree with this... lots of little projects can use a mailing 
list, a little FTP space, etc. but don't necessarily need to become SPI 
affiliated.  Remember, affiliation means we manage money, equipment etc. 
for them.  I think it's a good idea if the bigger ones become affiliated, 
but smaller ones I would like exempt from this requirement.


Nils.

ps. I don't think we need cvs for this, the mailing list should be 
sufficient with the proposer keeping track of the revs.

Dear Senator/Representative,

As the software world is becoming more open, it seems more clear than
ever that Intellectual Property law in the US, and in particular
the ability to patent software algorithms, is a hindrance rather than
an aid for future innovation.

USA is alone in honoring patents for such algorithms (at least in the
western world).  Innovation that could take place here is therefore
only possible abroad - such as in the EU or Japan.  One example is the
task bar in Microsoft Windows, which has been awarded a US patent.
Though prior art could easily be referred to should a case ever come
up, such a case would be very costly for a small entity fighting
Microsoft's massive legal apparatus.  As a result, other graphical
user interfaces are nowadays mostly developed in Europe (for instance,
the KDE and GNOME interfaces for UNIX).

I am also writing this despite being a primary applicant for a US
software patent.  While my invention is general in nature, my company
felt that we needed to protect ourselves from lawsuits by _other_
companies who _in the future_ might make a similar invention, by
applying first.

As you see, these laws are more than anything aimed at protecting
corporations from competition - and in the long run tend to have a
terrible effect on the emerging trend of colaborative development.

Thank you for your kind consideration,

Tor Slettnes

I agree with these sentiments. I think that we can go much further than
writing our congress, however. I would like to see us assemble a class
action law suit against the federal government with the purpose of declaring
that the current U.S. Patent system violates the garaunteed right to 
freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is arguably the most important
right granted in the constitution and intellectual property has become
a thinly veiled sham that grants corporations nearly absolute control
over the basic components from which new ideas are constructed. At the
current rate, in some short time it will become nearly impossible for 
hobbyist programmers to practice their art without risking the violation
of some overly broad patent.

Is any effort similar to this idea under way?

That is exactly what I am doing. Just like the Debian packaging policies
tie down a developer's "reactivity". Donating services is the only thing
that SPI does. The concept that this should be completely free-form and
not depend on making a project "officially SPI endorsed" is a bit odd.

SPI's mission is to give aid and assistance. If SPI gives aid and assistance
to a project then it is "SPI associated". Perhaps we can have different
levels of affiliation that provide different levels of service.

OK, I see where you're going... maybe officially endorsed is a bit too 
much.  SPI is intended to provide services to the projects that don't have 
the HW etc. to do it with... they need to share and be compatible with the 
SPI goals, but I don't think officially endorsed sounds right.  I wouldn't 
call a project that's got a mailing list hosted by us an 'official' 
project... maybe that should be reserved for projects for whom we handle 
money and hardware, not just mail, web, ftp, or cvs space...

That I agree with... the question is why would we need to define different 
levels?  I agree we should track project sizes, and the services they're 
using, but do we need to define levels?  As above, maybe money/hw handling 
vs. handling that plus the rest?

Nils.

ps. this is getting off topic from the equipment guidelines a little.  I 
still like the guidelines that I initially proposed.  I'll repost that 
with a few changes.

[Just added the 'purpose must be specified at time of donation' clause and 
reordered general guidelines.  If there are no more major 
objections/comments etc. I'll post it to the board for a vote next.  Nils.]

---------------------------------------------------------------
-Proposed Draft 2- Resolution 1999.03.03.nl
Guidelines for Equipment and Service Donations
---------------------------------------------------------------


General Guidelines for Donations
--------------------------------

- All equipment will be used to further the goals of SPI and its 
affiliated projects, and will be used in accordance with all SPI rules and 
regulations.

- All equipment and services donated to SPI or any of its affiliated 
projects must be used in compliance with any and all applicable laws.

- The criteria for differentiating between donated and loaned equipment 
shall be whether or not a transfer of ownership from the donor to SPI has 
taken place.


Equipment Guidelines
--------------------

- Donations of equipment can be marked for a specific project, or for SPI 
in general.  The latter is preferred as it allows SPI more flexibility in 
the usage of equipment.

- Equipment can be donated for a specific purpose.  SPI will make every 
attempt to use it for the specified purpose, but may at its discretion 
(and the discretion of the project that it was earmarked for, if 
applicable) change its use if this is deemed necessary.

- Equipment that is donated for a specific purpose must have that purpose 
clearly defined at the time of the donation.

- Equipment that is on loan to SPI or an affiliated project will be 
considered a service, and will be used under the service guidelines.


Service Guidelines
------------------

- Any restrictions on donations or their usage must be stated at the time 
of donation.

- If the donor wishes to change the conditions under which the service is 
donated or withdraw the service, he must inform SPI (and the project that 
the service is donated to, if applicable) 15 days in advance.

- If SPI (or the project that the service is donated to, if applicable) 
wishes to change the usage of the service, or use the service in a manner 
contrary to that initially specified, they must inform the provider of the 
service 15 days in advance.

I see that new discussion came up covering what I tried to start
back in december.  In order to put some oil in the chains here
is what I proposed last year.

I saw that.. I was trying to get something more general than this though, 
that way you can apply it to any service more easily.  The specific 
restrictions are left to the specific donation/loan in this case, which I 
think offers more flexibility to both parties and makes more sense.  If 
you think there are core ideas missing from what I've posted, please 
comment.

Nils.

Doesn't this make earmarking kind of pointless? There should be a
restriction in here.

I think you need a loophole in here that in some situations a donator
can require immediate termination. For example if something weird
happens and the donator might get into legal problems or thinks that
SPI abuses the donations.

I also miss the ability to earmark donations for a specific goal. A
donator should be able to say for example `I have this listserver you
can use, but only for security-related projects', or any other possible
restriction. Without this it is also impossible to make a donation
specifically for a single SPI project, such as Debian.

    I have been doing some reading on copyright/patent law for software
(though I am not a lawyer!), and from what I've read, it seems the courts
are inclined to take into account whether or not the supposed infringement
was in the public interest or not.
    Also looks like reverse engineering by disassembly may be all right,
_if_ you have an authorized copy, and it's the only (reasonable) way to
get at the non-copyrightable elements of the software (ideas and facts).
   If the software is covered by a patent, that's a point in your favor
too, since patents are supposed to encourage opening up ideas, not adding
extra locks on them.
  Warning: above is my interpretation of legal gobbledy-gook - whether
it's true or not I don't know.  What I am pretty sure about is that the
results of an infringement suit (copyright or patent) will probably be up
in the air until a lawsuit has actually gone to trial.

Lynn
PS.  I might agree with the class action lawsuit, but more because the
govt. is being negligent in its assignment of patents thereby giving out
govt-backed clubs for harrassment of potential software developers.

For the purposes of this agreement, "equipment" is understood to mean
any physical or monetary asset that is given, transferred or
otherwise donated to SPI for the purposes of furthering the SPI
effort or a SPI affiliated project.

- Any restrictions on donations or their usage must be stated at the time 
of donation. These restrictions are not subject to change after the assets 
have been transferred to SPI.

[edit of above]
- Equipment can be donated for a specific purpose.  SPI will make every 
attempt to use it for the specified purpose, but may at its discretion 
(and the discretion of the project that it was earmarked for, if 
applicable) change its use if this is deemed necessary and does not
violate any of the restrictions imposed by the donor.

> ------------------

For the purposes of this agreement, "service" is understood to mean
any asset which SPI has been granted use of, but does not own, for
the purposes of furthering the SPI effort or a SPI affiliated
projects. This might include, but is not limited to, donated network
bandwidth, usage of computing equipment or other physical equipment,
usage of space within a technical facility or other facility, or
services of personnel.

[Changes from Ean incorporated (thanks, Ean.  Good changes!).  I moved the 
restrictions at time of donation into the general section- made more sense 
there.  Looks like the resolution is close to mature.  Nils.]

---------------------------------------------------------------
-Proposed Draft 3- Resolution 1999.03.03.nl
Guidelines for Equipment and Service Donations
---------------------------------------------------------------

General Guidelines for Donations
--------------------------------

- All equipment will be used to further the goals of SPI and its 
affiliated projects, and will be used in accordance with all SPI rules and 
regulations.

- All equipment and services donated to SPI or any of its affiliated 
projects must be used in compliance with any and all applicable laws.

- The criteria for differentiating between donated and loaned equipment 
shall be whether or not a transfer of ownership from the donor to SPI has 
taken place.

- Any restrictions or usage requirements on donations must be stated at 
the time of donation. These restrictions are not subject to change after 
the assets have been transferred to SPI.  Restrictions on loans may be 
changed as described below.


Equipment Guidelines
--------------------

For the purposes of this agreement, "equipment" is understood to mean any 
physical or monetary asset that is given, transferred or otherwise donated 
to SPI for the purposes of furthering the SPI effort or a SPI affiliated 
project.

- Donations of equipment can be marked for a specific project, or for SPI 
in general.  The latter is preferred as it allows SPI more flexibility in 
the usage of equipment.

- Equipment can be donated for a specific purpose.  SPI will make every 
attempt to use it for the specified purpose, but may at its discretion 
(and the discretion of the project that it was earmarked for, if 
applicable) change its use if this is deemed necessary and does not
violate any of the restrictions imposed by the donor.

- Equipment that is on loan to SPI or an affiliated project will be 
considered a service, and will be used under the service guidelines.


Service Guidelines
------------------

For the purposes of this agreement, "service" is understood to mean any 
asset which SPI has been granted use of, but does not own, for the 
purposes of furthering the SPI effort or a SPI affiliated projects. This 
might include, but is not limited to, donated network bandwidth, usage of 
computing equipment or other physical equipment, usage of space within a 
technical facility or other facility, or services of personnel.

- If the donor wishes to change the conditions under which the service is 
donated or withdraw the service, they must inform SPI (and the project 
that the service is donated to, if applicable) 15 days in advance.

- If SPI (or the project that the service is donated to, if applicable) 
wishes to change the usage of the service, or use the service in a manner 
contrary to that initially specified, they must inform the provider of the

Oops, just noticed the singular/plural conflict in "a SPI affiliated
projects". Third line. Sorry.

AFAIK IBM is marketing postfix (AKA "IBM Secure Mailer") as open source,
even if there is a conflicting clause in the license.

I think debian or SPI should officially complain: if we don't act then
the trade mark will be diluited and we could lose it.

I understand the author (Wietse Venema) is willing to make it free but
needs arguments for IBM lawyers.

   Could there be a clause stating where descriptions of purposes may be
found?  This might help provide a common reference for projects.  I'm
particularly thinking that 2 people might want their donations to be used
for the same purpose, but described differently, particularly when there's
no existent effort to fulfill the purpose, or the purpose is an
intermittent one.  Like if someone donated money toward the legal defense
of free software developers on patent infringement suits.  Or services,
from lawyers.
   Also, a site describing the current funding status of the different
projects/purposes might be helpful in determining where one wants to 
dedicate their money (in some cases, you might decide not to donate for
a very under-funded one as compared to a better-funded one that
seems to be gathering some momentum.  or you might make the opposite
decision).

I haven't followed the discussion of the PostFix license in detail, but I
think we should have clear answers to the following questions should be
answered before we contact IBM officially:
- The conflicting clause is the revocation in case of patent issues one,
  right?
- Does the clause actually violate the OSD, or is it an oversight in the
  OSD/DFSG? If it is the latter, is it fixed in the current DFSG revision
  proposal drafts?
- Is the issue with PostFix only, or is it with Jikes too?

> I think debian or SPI should officially complain:

SPI holds the Open Source cerficiation mark, not Debian. What Debian can do
is to take this issue into account in the next DFSG revision.

I remember this has been discussed on debian-legal but I did not follow
the thread and I'm not able to comment.

 >- Is the issue with PostFix only, or is it with Jikes too?
IIRC the license is the same or very similar, but I could be wrong.

I do not believe it's forbidden in the current DFSG.  It has been addressed
in the draft to make clauses like this non-DFSG-free.

I'd rather not write that into the resolution as it's a technicality, not 
a general rule. I argee that this would be valuable, and it's something 
that we should probably put on our web site in the project pages.

  Yes, it would be.  This could also go on the project pages.

Thanks for the comments!

It might be wise to consider requiring people to not require a purpose for
donations to SPI but allow general use. 

If we allow a specifications of purpose:

Who is going to track that and make sure it is really used like that?

We need then to have a database of machines etc etc which is quite a
headache.

Given our limited administrative capabilities I dont think its wise to
allow people to restrict use for a certain purpose. Maybe restrict use for
a project but then the project should track the stuff.

I agree with Mr. Dassen regarding the urgency of resolving this situation.
Inaction by SPI will only increase the anxiety many people are
feeling about this matter.

Given the lack of public comment about the trademark, despite early
promises of action, it would seem that the disposition of the mark is not
really important to SPI. I, for one, would like to see the trademark
managed actively and without dispute. While the community is divided over
this issue, education and outreach about Open Source will retain the taint
of the dispute.

[This resolution lays down some basic definitions that will become 
important later on when the bylaws changes will be discussed- especially 
the voting section.  We will probably end up with different approvals for 
motions and resolutions- i.e. it should be easier to add the hosting of a 
mailing list to SPI that it should be to change the bylaws themselves. 
This resolution will be a building block for later discussions.

Comments/additions are welcome.  I know some of this is awkwardly worded, 
so please feel free to suggest improvements. --Nils]


---------------------------------------------------------------
-Proposed Draft- Resolution 1999-03-15.nl
Definition of Motions and Resolutions
---------------------------------------------------------------

This resolution defines the purposes and usages of resolutions and 
motions.  The approval of resolutions and motions will not be discussed in 
this document, but will follow the procedures outlined in the bylaws.  
Resolutions add or change procedures for the operation of SPI, but should 
(if possible) not include technical information.  Resolutions should be 
written generically so that they may be widely applied.


Resolutions
-----------
  A resolution shall be used when it is necessary to define a principle, 
procedure or operating guideline that changes the basic operation and 
administration of SPI.  It

Example resolutions include changing the SPI bylaws, establishing new 
procedures or guidelines of operation, and similar decisions.


Motions
-------
  A motion shall be used to change technical details within the operation 
of SPI.  These changes are only allowed to happen within the 
organizational framework of SPI as outlined by the charter, bylaws, and 
previous resolutions.  A motion changes or adds operational information, 
but does not change the basic operations of SPI.

Example motions include the acceptance of new projects, nominations of 
board members, and other technical issues.

I want people to be able to say that a donation may only be used for
Debian, so I really want to keep this in.

That requirement already has caused trouble. Often equipment from one
project will be used for others as well. How will you track those
limitations on equipment?

Keeping a log wouldn't be all that difficult.  We need to keep an
inventory, anyway.

- Equipment can be donated for a specific purpose.  SPI will make every 
attempt to use it for the specified purpose, but may at its discretion 
(and the discretion of the project that it was earmarked for, if 
applicable) change its use if this is deemed necessary and does not
violate any of the restrictions imposed by the donor.


read the 'but may at its discretion' part... perhaps we should remove the 
'...and does not violate any of the restrictions imposed by the donor." 
part?

    Well, I'm not sure it's actually a technicality.  In contrast with
other people on the list who've responded, I think there should be more
of a guarantee that funds will be used for specific purposes, and that
this promise of a site tracking donation/purpose status would help
assure them of that.
    I realize that there are administrative issues to consider.  But
we should also consider the article Jim Thompson wrote on Slashdot
about organizing an "open source donation clearing house" of sorts.
When I read it, my immediate reaction was, "but isn't that part of
what SPI is (planning on) doing?"  
   See, I tend to think there are a lot of people and companies who would
be willing to donate for particular purposes, but not necessarily just
open software, or even when the promise of using the funds is limited.
Furthermore, I think that if SPI limits its guarantees of how money will 
be used, then probably either another non-profit will arise to take and
track those donations, or (worse) the potential donors just won't give
funds.  And neither of those situations is desirable.  A unified front for
donations is very preferable.
   When I say that, keep in mind that I'm thinking that companies (not
just individuals) who need/use particular types of software could
reasonably be persuaded to give for those types of software - not only
would they get to use the software in the future, but unlike just
purchasing licenses, they would get a tax write off, and some guarantee
that the projects they donate for totally die because a particular 
developer loses interest.  This would be a big win for everyone, I think.

This message is not intended to be private.  However, it's posted to
debian-private as a 'heads-up'.  If you care about open source, please

for discussing it.

Please remove debian-private from any Cc:s.

Here's my take on the Apple/Open Source thing:

Don't bite the hand that feeds!  It's *good* news.  Slow down, everyone.
Apple releasing the source code to the bulk of MacOS X is really good
news.  MacOS X is an exciting piece of technology, and it would be
wonderful if it were Open Source.


Now, what do we do about the fact that it's not open source?

For the record:  2.2 (c) of the APSL fails point (3) of the OSD, since it
restricts distribution of modified versions (you may not do so unless you
notify Apple).  9.1, and 12.1 (c) whilst not obviously failing any point
of the OSD, are undesirable. 

In many other ways, however, the license is excellent.  For example, it
expressely grants a license for all Apple patents which the work might
infringe.

IMO, 9.1, which attempts to cover Apple's backs in case of patent
infringement, is adequately covered by 13.6.  12.1 (c) is just plain silly
:-(.  But I'm not a lawyer.


I think we should

a) Send feedback to Apple, expressing pleasure that they wish to open
source their project, and explaining our current problems with the APSL

b) Regain control of the OS mark, and enforce it.  Opensource.org should
have a high-profile front-page saying "The APSL is not currently
considered open-source, because..", "The IBM Jikes licenses is not
currently considered open-source, because..."

I agree. Let's go about it nicely at first, and if a company persists in
labelling something "Open Source" that isn't, use the judical system ("cease
and desist" letters).

Agreed, but most likely that means SPI will have to take back opensource.org
first. Bruce, you're the current administrative contact for opensource.org,
which is registered on behalf of SPI under its old address; what's your take
on this?

I got a few underlying things form the license. One is that if you
distribute modified source, you grant Apple a non-retractable full
license (equivilent to theirs) to your work, and anything under your
control that you used to create the modified version (they specifically
included things used to create it, like compiler, etc.) yet they
specifically have places in their license where they can revoke it.

There are also three seperate clause, that when investigated together,
reveal an alterior motive. If you look at the section mentioned above
that gives Apple rights to your modifications, then look at another
section (sorry no time to quote #.#'s) which says that source code may
be pre-release. A final section which says that final modifications to
the released package (when they take the work and retail it) will not
necessarily fall under the APSL.

I get _1_ thing from the above. Apple wants to release source of
pre-release software, have the the community work on fixing bugs and
adding features (which they then have rights to once you register them
on the website), take those features/fixes and incorporate them into a
final retail product which they will sell (without source) and the
community is left with non-release quality source.

Apple wants to reap all the benefits from us, and not give us full
discolure in return.

Then again, I may be suffering from "big business" paranoia.

Isn't that supposed to be my job?  (suffering from "big business"
paranoia that is)  My take on it was a bit less sinister, but perhaps a
bit misguided.  Seems they want a lot of the same things Netscape wanted
and we already decided those things were okay.

I believe that if we can get Eric to stop calling it Open Source when it
ain't even close, we have a chance to convince Apple to play nice.

That might be true.  Might even be Ok (tm).  because

> community is left with non-release quality source.
That is *not* necessarily true.  The community doesn't loose the original
source code OR the modifications made by the community.  All that would be
needed is some responsible soul from the community to take charge of all
the changes and release a "competing" product *with* all source code.

On the other hand (and I havn't read the license, I'm talking in general
theory) if Apple *does* remove rights to the changes they incorporate from
the community, that would be a Bad Thing.  

I'm amazed at the near total lack of trust in the Gnu developer community
towards their fellow developer.  We have a long history of matching and
surpassing non-free software.  The basic rule is, "anything cathedral can
do, bazaar can do better."  That has been proven time and time again.  So
what if Apple thinks it can abuse that.  Free Software will still put it
together stronger and better... and considering how "fast" corporations
work... the free version will be released before the non-free version no
matter that Apple tries to use pre-release code.  (after all, there is no
such thing as "pre-release" in the bazaar).

Just my $.02 worth...

Given the amount of contention regarding the trademark, the easiest thing to
do would be to place it in the public domain and let it die of lost meaning.

Regarding the domains, before we do something as hostile as to take them
away, I'd make sure we all agreed about that and had discussed it throughly.

If you read the press release, 
  http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=CnU3LubWbu0zuvta4o&FQ=Linux&SymH

you will see towards the bottom:
  "Open Source is a trademark of Apple Computer, Inc."


Like it or not, but now may be neccessary to come up with some of the
documents regarding the trademark, how it was handled initially etc.
Not only for Eric "Shoot Bill, get famous" Raymond, but in actual
legal confronation with Apple.

Please note the press release now has the correct trademark information.  
Sorry about the confusion.

Section 3(a) says that you grant a license equivalent to the Apple
licence to third parties, section 3(b) says you grant Apple an
irrevocable licence to do whatever they want with your code.

I wouldn't call the 3(b) license "equivalent to theirs".


I see they quote Eric Raymond of "The Open Source Initiative" on their
web page - maybe SPI should retract his license to use the trademark
"Open Source" for that organization.

Thanks for pointing this out - that is a good relief.

The trademark is still subject of a dispute between SPI (which had it
registered), and OSI (which claims to have obtained it from SPI).
Eric Raymond is the president/primadonna of OSI.  The one person who
may have the most influence in dealing with this trademark legally is
Bruce Perens, who has publicly pointed out a couple of (minor)
problems with the ASPL.

As that may be, thanks for your clarification.

In good faith, I think that's a typo.  It actually reads:

  NOTE: Apple, the Apple logo, Macintosh, Mac OS, Power Macintosh and
  WebObjects are registered trademarks of Apple Computer, Inc. Open Source
  is a trademark of Apple Computer, Inc.

I don't see a reason why "Apple Computer, Inc." should be mentioned twice. 
It would be interesting to know what they intended to write there...
"Software in the Public Interest"?  I hope.

   It's better, but now it doesn't recognize Open Source as a trademark at
all.  It should (of Software in the Public Interest).

Actually we usually hope this phrase in our trademark language covers 
third party trademarks....

"Additional company and product names may be trademarks or registered 
trademarks of the individual companies and are respectfully acknowledged".

    It's not the developers I don't trust.  It's the management.  We have
no way of knowing what kind of politics are being played here, i.e. how
much of this arises from their developers thinking its a good idea, vs.
the management seeing it as a free work force.
    I don't expect Apple to go off the deep end in making its source code
open.  I'm sure their lawyers would be tearing their hair out if they did.
On the other hand, I've got better ways to spend my coding time than
contributing to works that can be yanked out of an open state.
   In other words, I'm impressed to see Apple take this step in the right
direction, and not surprised that the first step is somewhat timid in its
scope.  I'm sure someone had to have some guts to even propose the idea
(media blitz or no).  And if I were a Mac owner/user, I would be glad to
have the source code so that I could fix the inevitable bugs that
interfere with daily computing life.  But I have some doubts if I would
release my fixes, when Apple could co-opt them.  
   On the other hand, making modifications to a copy of a program you own
and distributing those modifications is legal with or without Apple's
permission.  But I'm not sure how that would be affected by the "license".

    I believe that if we can get Eric to stop calling it Open Source when it
    ain't even close, we have a chance to convince Apple to play nice.

IS Eric calling it "open source"?  Has the Open Source Initiative said
anything yet about this license?  I would not expect them to endorse a
license which does not give permission to distribute modified
versions.

I have sent mail to fetch a copy of the license so I can see what it
says.

not sure if it was not the mention that it was open source in the sence of the
cited document (somewhere on the opensource site) that made people thing Eric
or other Open source people said it was ...

I'm afraid Eric is.

It says this in Apple's license FAQ.

Yesterday, SPI and Bruce Perens sent Apple a gentle open letter, welcoming
the move, but not proclaiming it OS.

http://perens.com/APSL.html

Today (at least, today in my personal time zone ;), Eric rebutted that, at

http://lwn.net/1999/0318/a/raymond.html

If I gather from the above that you don't have web access from where you
are, Richard, I'm happy to email you any/all of the above.

I haven't seen this mentioned yet: The description of the Open Source 
certification mark as published on the USPTO web site is quite intriguing:

  "The certification mark, as used by authorized persons, certifies that
   the software license conforms to a set of guidelines published by
   software in the public interest."

I.e. Open Source is defined as conformance to guidelines published by 
SPI! That's quite nice, isn't it ?

The complete USPTO entry is at
http://trademarks.uspto.gov/cgi-bin/ifetch4?ENG+ALL+3+921980+0+1+141168+F+2+2+1+MS%2fOpen+AND+MS%2fSource

It's not even that.  Who cares of Apples sees the Free Software community
as a free work force?  We havn't met, but I'm going to assume you don't
work for Apple, but let's say take Apple's source and add the neat FooBar
system that causes apple to blow away Microsoft and even Linux in their
commercial software... and that commercial software is non-free. =20

Surely you, or someone you know that is interested in Apple's software,
will take Apple's released code.. and your change and put together the same
(and probably better) system.  And if Apple also added (but never released)
the barfoo option, the team that's taken of Applzilla will surely implement
it's on barfoo option, too.

As long as Apples doesn't (and it does, so this is all hypothetical) have
that dratted termination clause on the original release of source code,
there is nothing that can stop the Free Software community from having a
free version of Apples' software.

My initial... rant... was directed more at a general situtation.  More
directed at the GPL or nothing people.  That license displays the same lack
of belief in the Free Software community to match and beat the Closed=20
community in anything the Closed community can put out.

To change the topic... Apple even had a pseudo-accepted (we havn't been
loud enough in our objections to reach Apple's ears) example to go by in
IBM.

  The time has come to begin discussing the changes that need to be made 
to the bylaws.  The most important changes will be regarding the 
memberships, and the voting.  Later changes will address committees, etc.  
These will be attacked in order, with membership being first as this is 
currently the more hazy issue, and a lot of questions have been raised 
about it.

The bylaws can be found on the SPI web site at <http://www.spi-inc.org/corp
orate/spi-bylaws>.

Articles 1 and 2 will never change, as they need to stay consistent with 
the COI (Certificate of Incorporation- also online).  Article 3 is the 
membership article, and this will be discussed first.  As this article is 
discussed, please keep in mind that the entire bylaws will be gradually 
revised, so the articles don't necessarily have to be consistent with 
other articles.

Technically, the way the revisions will work is as follows:
- write resolutions to change the various articles (one at a time, to 
avoid confusion and multiple simultaneous discussions- tough to keep track 
of!)
- discuss the resolutions until they're ready to be voted on
- the board will then vote on them.
- once all necessary articles of the bylaws have been changed, they should 
be voted into the actual bylaws as a block.  This ensures that the bylaws 
are not inconsistent with themselves at any given time, and thus avoids 
confusion.

If anyone has any problems with the general approach, please let me know.  
I've been thinking about this a long time (about 5 months) and this is IMO 
the best way to approach the problem.

I plan on posting the proposed changes to the membership articles in the 
next day or so (hopefully).

Nils.

Just to be clear... after the board votes on the revision, ist the revision part of
the bylaws... or does this "new bylaws" not take actual affect until the
final vote on the bylaws as a block?

I have had several discussions with Ian, Joey, and Dale about this, and 
this will be the first time those thoughts are really put down in writing. 
Eventually it would be nice to have a document that contains all of the 
rationales behind the articles- that way people can see the 'spirit of the 
law' as well as the letter.

Actually, before the real 'writing' I'd like to outline a few possible 
scenarios.  I'm not sure which one makes most sense... all have their 
advantages and drawbacks.  I'm somewhat torn between scenarios 1&2- I'm 
not sure which is better suited to SPIs goals.

I'd like to figure out which scenario makes the most sense (and why!!) and 
then figure out the details, and then actually write the bylaws article.  
When commenting on this, please don't just ask questions- also try to 
propose solutions at the same time.

Discussion season is open.

Nils.


Scenario 1:
-----------
  'flat' membership.  In this case everyone who agrees with the principles 
and goals of SPI can become a member.  Voting can be either limited to 
voting for board embers, or voting on resolutions etc. as well (with 
quorums established etc.).

ADVANTAGES:
  - No membership levels (i.e. flat membership)
  - very little administrative work
  - greater membership carries more political weight
  - advantages if members only vote for the board members is that SPI can 
be very reactive (in terms of speed).  If you think about it, you're 
electing the people that listen to the discussions, and then make the 
decisions (i.e. vote on the resolutions that have been developed).

DISADVANTAGES
  - if members vote on resolutions etc. then the voting process will take 
a lot longer.  Thus SPI will be less reactive.  Perhaps the board can be 
permitted to approve a resolution with a super majority (2/3 + 1 or 
something similar)
  - more/less informed members (some will be more/less active) mean 
discussions will likely last longer


Scenario 2:
-----------
  tiered membership.  Have 'contributing members' and 'supporting members' 
where the contributing members have to be active in the free software 
world in some way.
  contributing members can vote on board members and resolutions
  supporting members can not vote, but can propose resolutions

ADVANTAGES:
  - voting is easier since there will be less people who have to vote
  - voters will be more informed since they're more active
  - SPI still gets the large membership base

DISADVANTAGES
  - you need to define contributing (that's not hard) and somehow verify 
that the member is contributing.  A neat idea would be two year 
memberships and at the end of the two years you have to send a mail 
stating what you've done in the last two years for the community.
  - more administrative work- the membership committee has to worry about 
all this
  - do we _want_ to create a difference between members? i.e. the 
discussion is going and someone says 'but I'm a contributing member and 
you're not!'  Yuck.  Ugly.


Scenario 3:
-----------
  only contributing members are allowed.  (I personally don't like this 
option at all.)

ADVANTAGES
  - informed members
  - simpler (shorter) voting periods

DISADVANTAGES
  - much much smaller membership -> less political weight.  If we're 
trying to represent and stand for the community, we should allow anyone in.
  - less of a range of opinions in the discussions and less interest in 
the discussions.  why should non members join in?

For those of you reading this, I've not written this linearly.  For
example, I started with a comment to Scenario 3.

With the three given scenarios, I'd choose this one.  The whole membership
should be given rights to vote on the board *AND* resolutions.  The Board
should appoint any and all committees to a tenure that ends at the board's
next election and the Board/Committee should be given a respectable amount
of freedom to act.  There is no reason we need a resolution to decide that
Apple's or IBM's licenses are not Open Source as claimed and to act.  

Resolutions should be left for guiding the board... but the board and
committee's should have the latitude to "react".

Bad, very bad.  There is only ONE way I'd consider accepting divided
memebership and that would be individual/project.  That would be it and Ean
and I have very opposite views on how that should be organized so I won't
get into it.  Even then, we both agree it would be "flat" WRT privilages.

You forgot the most imporant DISADVANTAGE.  Loss of focus.  SPI is supposed
to exist to promote the interests of Free Software.  How does it do this?
By an eleet membership roster!  I don't think I could even support such a
closed organization.  At the very least, this option should go against
everything SPI stands for.. or was formed to stand for.  I suppose it's an
option, but it should be considered about as much as far as it takes to
throw it out.

Take care in this matter. The truth of the matter is that the Debian
Free Software Guidelines were created by the combined efforts and 
discussions of Debian developers over the several years that Debian
has conducted its effort to build an "all Free Software" operating
system. Via a series of discussions and on-line editing sessions these
best practices were condensed into a single document. While Bruce was
a useful note taker and editor in these events I find his self attribution
of "principal author" a bit self serving.

A particularly illustrative situation is the IBM Jikes license. Bruce
was called in by IBM to analyze their license before it was ever presented
to the public. Bruce declared the license to be Open Source and it was
subsequently released to the public. Many people took issue with the 
patent clause, the termination clause, and other key elements. After
the negative public reaction, Bruce's claim was that IBM had shown him
a version of the license without these items. This is certainly curious
considering that the objectionable material constitutes almost half
of the material in the license. If IBM did show Bruce a different license
it was almost the same one. It seems to me that if a pack of IBM lawyers
were going to call in a subject matter expert that they would not be
inclined to show him an almost completely different license from the
one they intend to release.

In no way should the opinions of a single person be taken as bona-fide
"Open Source" attribution at this time. Anyone who tells you that they
can grant such is almost certainly lying. Both Eric and Bruce have
attempted to bestow the Open Source status on various licenses that 
were found wanting in the eyes of the community. The single best
barometer of Open Sourceness at this juncture would be a period of
public review and feedback from OSI and SPI that states the opinion
of their informed parties. I realize that this is, at best, a slow
and inexact process but the issues are complex and relatively new.

I think one useful concept is to have representative minority veto be
part of the equation. So that there is a special class of members
(board or directing members, if you will) that can fabricate potential
new policies. In certain cases (controlled by policy) there should be
resolutions that can be voted in with a 5 or 7 day veto period. Some
items might be whether a license is Open Source or something like that.

If the motion survives the veto period without recieving a representative
minority veto then it passes. Reasonably, I cannot see much of any
situation that requires such a quick turn around. The only thing I can
think of is press releases representing community opinion. This, however,
is difficult and slow to assess and reasonably could not be fabricated
in a short time frame.

I think we need to be clear what the purpose of the membership is,
from the point of view of the organisation.  From my point of view,
that purpose is control and accountability.  That is:

The membership should/will control SPI, and SPI's board and ultimately
everyone that acts for SPI will be held accountable to the membership.

So, given what SPI's purpose is (broadly speaking, to help the free
software development community by doing certain things that require
legal personality), we can see that that membership ought to be the
people who are supposed to benefit from SPI's abilities as a legal
entity: free software developers.

I see a very real risk that if SPI ends up legally owning significant
amounts of copyrights, patents, trademarks, money and other property,
it could easily become an effective target for `hijacking' by sudden
large numbers of new members, in order to wrest control of SPI's
assets away from their intended purposes.  This kind of thing is
already happening regularly to eg Building Societies[1] in Britain.

[1] A Building Society is a mutual society.  It's a financial
institution, a bit like a savings and loan.

I don't think we can rely on SPI's charter and contracts/trusts with
associated projects to protect us from this kind of thing.  Instead,
we need to make it difficult for `just anybody' to become a voting
member.

Therefore, I'm very strongly opposed to Nils's Scenario 1, with a
completely flat and open membership.

Instead, I believe that voting membership should be open to
individuals who have contributed significantly to the free software
community.  This will, unfortunately, require some effort to
administer, but the alternatives (dictat by the Board vs. the
possibility of hijacking) are much worse.

I don't particularly care whether there is an additional non-voting
`associate membership' or some such.  There seems little point though
- what is the purpose of these associate members ?  Just to make them
feel good ?

Ian.

Ean-
  The current discussion is about the general purpose of membership and 
its structure- we're not discussing voting etc. yet.  Please keep this in 
mind and bring it up again when we discuss the voting after the basic 
membership issues have been decided on.  Do you have any comments 
regarding membership and the three scenarios I proposed?

Nils.

    I was thinking of a two tiered membership in the following way.
[level 1] (significant contributors to free software) 
          right to vote on all policy issues
          can serve on all committees
[level 2] (enthusiasts)
          can vote on non-policy issues (times/places of general meetings,
	      SPI t-shirt design, other things that organizations
              do that don't affect their policy direction).
          can serve on minor committees (non-policy committees) (?)

   Major committees (those making policy decisions/recommedations) would
have their membership voted on by level 1.
   Minor committees could have their membership voted on by everyone.  
This is because, while enthusiasts might not be good programmers, they
still might be very good at evangelizing and spreading the word.
Actually, it's likely there are be non-programming types who are much
at PR than the programmers.
   
   This brings me to a question, which is what exactly will count as
contributing to the free software community.  Presumably, this does not
mean _only_ developers, but also people who write documentation, or are
heavily involved in spreading the good word, or volunteer to do the dirty
work behind any organization (setting up tables for a public meeting comes
to mind).  Possibly some kind of record of volunteer hours could be kept
and once someone had exceeded those hours they could go from enthusiast to
significant contributor.  Another possibility is to have a committee
dedicated to membership decisions.  In cases where a dispute arises 
(personal conflicts, probably) a general vote could be requested, and if
a majority vote in favor, that person would go to level 1. (members not
sending in their votes within some specified time would be presumed to 
be voting no, to prevent a large time wastage by frivolous disputes).
   I would also think membership should be subject to renewal.  If a
developer stops working on free software for, say, a year, then s/he's
off level 1.  Same with members who get in by volunteering - they'd
need to keep up their efforts.  After some time, say 5 years, level 1
membership would become permanent, barring some action fundamentally
contrary to the nature of SPI (voted on by 3/4 majority).   Of course,
there are a number of folks who would be grandfathered in now as permanent
members.

  There are other variations on this (perhaps only permanent members
[level 0] could serve on the board?).

   Anyway, I do think there is good reason to have an enthusiast level
membership.  They would be on the [snail] mailing list for promotions and
such as well.  Plus, it's just plain good sense to include your users -
that's one of the reasons free software works so well (I think).

In some sense, we already have this in Debian, with the difference between
users and developers. Not often do I see developers "pull rank" over users.
And I agree with Ian that there is an difference between free software
developers and free softare community members we shouldn't deny.

Agreed. The free software community is larger than the free software
developers though, and I think it is important that members of the free
software community that are not free software developers can participate
to SPI to some degree.

Agreed (for voting membership of contributing members).

I don't think your line of reasoning requires that an "associate membership"
be non-voting. For instance, many democracies have a two-tier voting system.
"associate members" could have the vote in the same way as the British House
of Commons, with "contributing members" acting as a House of Lords: senior
members of the community, that can overrule resolutions approved by the
associate members.

> There seems little point though - what is the purpose of these associate

No. To ensure the participation/representation of the free software
community as a whole in SPI.

I don't think that the issues are distinct. Usually, when there are
distinct "levels" in a governmental organization the distinctive attributes
of those levels are their roles in voting processes. What is the purpose
of separating the membership into these various functional components? I
saw this as an effort to create focused groups of well informed members
that could carry out decisions on particular key areas without requiring
a vote of the complete body of members. I was suggesting the veto action
as a method for integrating the opinion of the larger membership body into
the actions of these smaller groups.

It seems to me that the mechanisms for arriving at consensus (voting, etc.)
are the primary motivator for making functional divisions within
the voting body.

Does that make sense?

Up to this point I agree. I believe that prospective members must show
some proof of participation. Obviously Debian developers have all the
proof that they need, and members of other supported projects as well.

Authorship of a piece of free software should also qualify.

I suspect that it will take some kind of "membership committee" to decide
on the less obvious cases.

I had the same feeling until it dawned on me that associate members are a
path to full membership. If you want to be productive and helpful in the
Free Software community, you become an associate member of SPI where you
can do productive work that will earn you a full membership. Something
like the, each member must do work for SPI at least once a year, clause
that currently exists (I think).

While it isn't clear to me just what "jobs" would be available to these
folks, I think that it is worth considering.

Waiting is,

After studying Apple's new source code license, the APSL, I have
concluded that it falls short of being a free software license.  It
has three fatal flaws, any of which would be sufficient to make the
software less than free.

* Disrespect for privacy.

  The APSL does not allow you to make a modified version and use it for
  your own private purposes, without publishing your changes.

* Central control.

  Anyone who releases (or even uses, other than for R&D) a modified
  version is required to notify one specific organization, which happens
  to be Apple.

* Possibly of revocation at any time.

  The termination clause says that Apple can revoke this license, and
  forbid you to keep using all or some part of the software, any time
  someone makes an accusation of patent or copyright infringement.

  In this way, if Apple declines to fight a questionable patent (or
  one whose applicability to the code at hand is questionable), you
  will not be able to have your own day in court to fight it, because
  you would have to fight Apple's copyright as well.

  Such a termination clause is especially bad for users outside the
  US, since it makes them indirectly vulnerable to the insane US
  patent system and the incompetent US patent office, which ordinarily
  could not touch them in their own countries.

Any one of these flaws makes a license unacceptable.

If these three flaws were solved, the APSL would be a free software
license with three major practical problems, reminiscent of the NPL:

* It is not a true copyleft, because it allows linking with other
files which may be entirely proprietary.

* It is unfair, since it requires you to give Apple rights
to your changes which Apple will not give you for its code.

* It is incompatible with the GNU GPL.

Of course, the major difference between the NPL and the APSL is that
the NPL *is* a free software license.  These problems are significant
in the case of the NPL because the NPL has no fatal flaws.  Would that
the same were true of the APSL.

At a fundamental level, the APSL makes a claim that, if it became
accepted, would stretch copyright powers in a dangerous way: it claims
to be able to set conditions for simply *running* the software.  As I
understand it, copyright law in the US does not permit this, except
when encryption or a license manager is used to enforce the
conditions.  It would be terribly ironic if a failed attempt at making
a free software license resulted in an effective extension of the
range of copyright power.

Aside from this, we must remember that only part of MacOS is being
released under the APSL.  Even if the fatal flaws and practical
problems of the APSL were fixed, even if it were changed into a very
good free software license, that would do no good for the other parts
of MacOS whose source code is not being released at all.  We must
not judge all of a company by just part of what they do.

Overall, I think that Apple's action is an example of the effects of
the year-old "open source" movement: of its plan to appeal to business
with the purely materialistic goal of faster development, while
putting aside the deeper issues of freedom, community, cooperation,
and what kind of society we want to live in.

Apple has grasped perfectly the concept with which "open source" is
promoted, which is "show users the source and they will help you fix
bugs".  What Apple has not grasped--or has dismissed--is the spirit of
free software, which is that we form a community to cooperate on the
commons of software.

Since October 1998, I have been maintaining the website of the League
for Programming Freedom at <http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/>. On this site,
there is an email address where people can write to offer their help.

A number of people have offered to help, but unfortunately there is no
defined agenda for the LPF. The League has no formal organization
right now and I am limiting myself to the role of a webmaster.

I am posting this article here in hopes of starting a discussion among
people who would be interested in forming a steering committee for the
LPF. These people would have to decide what they specifically want to
do to obtain the abolition of software patents by the
U.S. Congress. The LPF also opposes user interface copyrights, but
since a major 1996 U.S. Supreme Court decision, this problem seems to
have receded for now (see the website for details).

The job of the committee would be to define a strategy to eventually
convince Congress of outlawing software patents. Recent news about
Microsoft's patent on style sheets and Sightsound's threats against
MP3.com (regarding patents over downloading audio over a network) may
provide arguments to convince lawmakers that software patents should
be abolished as soon as possible before they become an intolerable
impediment to the software community. A letter-writing campaign might
be a good start; I could post the results on the website.

Greg Aharonian's Internet Patent News Service has published some
issues about the two patents I mentioned:
<http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/patents.html#IPNS>

The front page of the LPF website shows an index to the article
"Against Software Patents", which is a very good read for anyone who
wishes to have a reminder of why software patents are a threat.

i think it is worth pointing out here that the rapid bug-fixing and
development of features is merely a side-effect of this spirit of free
software.  i.e. it is *because* we know that the software is free and can
never be taken away from us, and *because* we know we are contributing to
the common good that we are willing to volunteer our time and energy and
skills to improving free software.

without that security of knowledge, why should we bother? we would be
better off putting our time and energy into something which was truly
free than putting it into something which may be taken away from us in
the future.

free software is, IMO, an example of enlightened self-interest - we
are helping others by helping ourselves, and making an investment in
software "infrastructure" which will benefit us all for decades (or
more) to come.

It's a nightmare.  It looks like it's _mostly_ aimed at limited AT&T's
liability.  At least they included "non-frivolous" with regards to the
patent infringement case...

   I also love how they capitalize YOU everywhere.

I would like to see us get involved with this.

Personally, I am curious to see whether we could bring a class action
suit against the United States government under the arguement that 
software patents, in their current state, violate a Free Software 
programmer's freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is a gauranteed
human right and is supposed to be stronger legally than a patent, which 
is a tool of convenience. I think it is arguable that many programmers
are as dedicated to the creation of Free Software as any religious person
is to their chosen method of worship.

I, personally, cannot reach a solid decision on the Apple license and
would like to bounce some ideas off of you to see if it can solidify
my thinking. It strikes me that the notification clauses, while 
inconvenient, do not render the software proprietary. You still have
complete freedom to modify the code and use it for whatever purpose
you care to. In some ways, depending on Apple's future behavior, this
could be seen as a tool for increasing freedom. If Apple agressively
redistributes the modifications that they are notified of then a very
large amount of software may become publicly available from their
efforts.

The patent clauses are curious and I can see the danger in the fact that
Apple can keep you from ever getting a chance to fight a patent in court.
On the other hand, Apple has granted use of an unknown number of patents
for use in free software. This seems like a good thing. Is your arguement
with the way they have coupled the license issues with the patent issues?
I suppose I can see the danger in that, they have made the copyright an
extension of the patent. Hmmm. ?

    I don't think we need to contest it on 1st amendment grounds.  The
thing is, distributing source code (maybe even binary code) is expression
and can't infringe on a patent.  But what does infringe on the patent is
when the software is actually loaded into the computer and executed, which
then makes the computer an instantiation of the patented device.  In
essence, you "manufacture" an infringing device each time you execute the
program.  
   At least, this is what I've gathered.  The distinction is a technical
one, but it's consistent with the way the courts have ruled between the 
copyrightable parts of software (the actual expression) versus the
patentable parts (the actual functioning).
   I don't know if you could be sued for "contributory infringement",
though.  
   The better grounds for a lawsuit defense (I think) would be to argue
that it's in the public interest to foster free software development.
>From what I've been reading, the courts (particularly the Supreme Court)
consider themselves to be the arbiter of what this is and have 
used it in the past as grounds for revoking patents.  I'm not sure about
the current SC, though.  But Justice O'Connor did make an encouraging
statement in one case that I've seen quoted several times (though of
course I can't find it when I look for it) about how the IP laws exist to
serve the public, not the IP monopolist, and when those two conflict, the
public wins.
   
   I am not a lawyer, I've just taken an active interest in this area,
since it seems to me we have a fundamental interest in making the law work
for us (as opposed to only those who can pay for it).

   Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on Technology?  They have expressed some

good idea to establish a working relationship with some of these other

My point is more to the fact that it is nearly impossible for an independant
programmer to find out if they are infringing on a patent. The patent 
database is intractibly large, lacks proper search tools and contains
absurd numbers of patents that are overly broad. What this equates to is
an environment that is uncomfortable, if not openly hostile, to the
independant programmer.

I know HERT once said they had a lawyer willing to help with things like
this. Then again I don't think they ever thought on this kind of scale.

>From the discussions it seems that people favor the two tiered membership  
approach, so here's an initial whack at the bylaws article.

Note that I'm _not_ discussing voting in here... that's the next topic for 
the other bylaws article.  This is _just_ for the details of what 
membership is, and what rights and obligations etc. _other_ than voting it 
entails.

Right now it's written in a chopped up form to make it easier to read... 
as the discussion draws to a close, I'll put it in a more 'readable' 
paragraph form.

IWJ- your points I have considered and included in this mail

Lynn- your points are regarding voting and committee service- both of 
these articles will be discussed later (I already have started rewriting 
the committee one.  Which members can serve where should be defined in 
there.)

Everyone else- thanks for your comments. I've read them all over prior to 
writing this and think I've included most concerns.

Nils.

ps. an aside- let's get this done quickly if possible, then we can get a 
membership and have committees to take care of things like OS and LPF etc. 
 This would take a LOT of strain off the current board members.



General
-------
[this section is for information that applies to all members]

[The membership should/will control SPI, and SPI's board and ultimately
everyone that acts for SPI will be held accountable to the membership. 
--iwj email]
[somehow I'd like to phrase this into a good sentence.  Suggestions? :)]


- There are contributing and non-contributing membership available within 
this organization.  All membership applications will be reviewed by the 
Membership Committee.
[where do we state the complete list of membership criteria?  Here?  In 
the charter for the membership committee?  What should the criteria be?]

- all members agree to the general goals principles of SPI and agree to 
help support the organization.
[This wording is ugly.  Basically, I want to say that members should 
(must?) agree with what SPI stands for and is trying to achieve.]

- members may leave the organization at any time by notifying the 
membership committee of their desire for the membership to be terminated.


Contributing Members
--------------------

- becoming a contributing member
   The applicant must apply for a contributing membership and include a 
list of projects or free software related activities that they have 
participated in (including what they have done) within the last two years 
(more may be included if desired).  This will be reviewed by the 
membership committee.
[should we define more tangible criteria here (or in the membership 
committee charter) or leave it a little open ended?  how significant a 
contribution should it be (point from iwj email)??]

- term of membership
   The contributing membership will expire two years from the date of 
issue of the membership.  It may be renewed.  If it is not renewed, the 
member will be downgraded to a non-contributing member.  To again become a 
contributing member at a later time, the person can simply follow the 
renewal procedure.
[I think 2 years is reasonable, and the downgrading is also a feasible 
idea for handling the memberships.]

- renewal of membership
   The member will be notified one month ahead of time that the membership 
is due to expire and will be asked to send a renewal application with a 
list of projects or free software related activities that they have 
participated in within the last two years.  This will be reviewed by the 
membership committee.
[I like this approach... easily automated too]

- board members
   Board members, by virtue of their office, are automatically 
contributing members.
[board members are working for SPI so by definition are contributing.]


Non-contributing Membership
---------------------------
[this section seems short, but then again, I don't think it should be that 
hard to become a non contributing member.  Look at javalobby.org- all 
members do is basically support the 'write once, run anywhere' concept.  
I'm picturing the same for SPI- non contrib members just support the 
principles of SPI.]

- becoming a non-contributing member
   The applicant must apply for a non-contributing membership.  The 
application will be reviewed by the membership committee.

- term of membership
   The membership will not expire.

I'm not totally sure what you're driving at... on the surface, it's obvious
that the membership controls the organization.. ultimatly.  Surely you are
not talking about the day to day business.  Do you want to list member
resposiblities?  Why we have members?  I've tried 7 or 8 suggested sentance
but none fit because I don't know where you want the introduction to lead.
That being said... here's something that seems to fit with the rest of the
letter...

Members are the ultimate controlling body of SPI, Inc.  Although the
day-to-day business is carried out by the Board of Directors and their
committees, the members have the responsibility to oversee the Board and
make sure it functions within the goals and principles of SPI as set forth
in this document (and the root of SPI should be here or in the articles of
Inc.).

That depends on how "fluid" you want the membership requirements to be.
Something defined in the bylaws should be harder to change than something
defined in a "lesser" document.  The way it's harder to change our
constitution than it is the change the Laws of U.S.A.

Members agree to support SPI's goals.  

This give a little out.  "Joe" might not agree 100% with everything (he
doesn't like the GPL because it's a virus in his eyes) but SPI supports it
so he'll also support it, but not use it in his own code.

I agree :)

Why?  Why not "Only contributing members can be board members"  Is the job
of being a board member going to be so full they won't have time to
contribute to another project?

The applicaton must apply for non-contributing membership stating they
support the principles of SPI.

Just for clarity and balance.  Otherwise, it's not needed.

I'd have it expire in 2 years also... basicly a ping to take them off the
email lists if they don't respond...

Well,  it'd be nice to make the distinction that "the _members_ control
SPI",  not "the board controls SPI".  At the moment,  it is (on the
surface) the other way around.

How about just like we do for Debian:

	A member must meet the criteria set forth by the Membership
Committee acting on behalf of the Company.

That way,  the membership requirements can be more flexible.  We could
even set it up so that the membership committee,  in circumstances of
extreme uncertainty,  can thus query the current membership and say "We're
sitting on the fence.  Should 'Joe' be a member?"

Except in the broadest terms, that's for a membership section of this
document.  It's spelled out, maybe in a section that defines the board or a
section that defines voting, *how* the board is controled...

That might work -- it'd be an interesting experiment -- but it's usually
good in the "entity" world (SPI is a legal entity/"person") to have atleast
*some* guidelines so the outside world can look on and see that all is well
(such as policies of non-discrimination, for example)

I think there are two issues here: the requirement to publish changes
and the requirement to notify a specific party.

The requirement to publish changes, even if the changes are not being
used by the public in any way, violates an essential privacy right.

The requirement to notify a specific party when you release a modified
version is perhaps not fatal, but I have a bad feeling about it.

    The patent clauses are curious and I can see the danger in the fact that
    Apple can keep you from ever getting a chance to fight a patent in court.
    On the other hand, Apple has granted use of an unknown number of patents
    for use in free software. This seems like a good thing.

These are two separate actions.  The latter would be a good thing, not
a problem, of course, but the former is a problem.

(Though in fact they have not granted "use in free software" of these
patents, only use in this particular software, whose freeness or not
is the question here.)

Ok,  how about:
	"A person desiring [active/voting] membership must be determined
to have made significant contribution to the Free Software community or to
another activity or project directly relating to the [published] goals and
ideals of SPI.  This determination will be made by the Membership
Committee acting on behalf of the membership of SPI." 

	Then you can put the standard "SPI will not discriminate
on the basis of race, color, age, sex, sexual preference, species or
anything else" clause at the bottom of the whole document.

Actually I oppose it if there is any alternative to be found.  It would
cause the higher tier of membership to become a status symbol.  I think
anyone familiar with my rants about GNOME of late should be well aware
that I feel the GNOME project is doing poorly if their goal is to produce
good software because the people running the project are too busy
building their own egos to actually build anything useful.

As a result GNOME is at any given point half broken, bloated, and
generally unusable if you need something that works now.  I'd rather not
see this happen with SPI, though it may be necessary for the reasons
others have cited.  I'm just very leery about letting any one or any
small group determine if someone's contribution to the community is
"worthy" of being allowed into the upper ranks.  I'm worried this is
likely to push anyone but those who have published and popular code out
of consideration, even if they have done other things that are extremely
important.

Forgive me if my faith in the community is not all that strong in this
regard.  I hear all the time that we need more people to pick up the
non-code areas which are being ignored.  People to write docs and howtos,
people to advocate for Free Software in positive ways, that sort of
thing.  Yet where is the notoriety in these things?  Nobody knows who
these people are and their work is taken for granted.  The more we try to
limit ourselves to the elite, the more it's going to simply become a
popularity contest and the more these people who are probably most
responsible for where we are now are going to be excluded.

Try two, for readability:

The membership shall control SPI and the SPI board.  All who act on SPI's
behalf will untimately be held accountable to the membership.

I would say membership charter.  See above for my concerns as to the
criteria I've heard voiced of "significant contribution to the community"
differenciating the "non-contributing" and the "contributing" members.  I
don't think the criteria for becoming a non-contributing member should be
too discriminative if we're going to have this tier setup.  If it's
reasonable to go with a flat membership and we do so, we'll need to be a
bit more careful about who we let in the door, so to speak.

Aren't these spelled out in a mission statement?  Why not simply refer to
that?

I'm really more interested in who decides what is "significant" if we
leave it open ended.  I think perhaps reference to another document might
be good here as well--not so much because of the chance of revision but
because of the likelyhood this will be read over the Internet on a web
page and if we are going to have hyperlinks we may as well use them in a
way which is going to promote readability of the finished product.

I think this is a good idea, actually.  Do you think two years is a good
time length or is one year a better time frame?  Either one is fine with
me.

I think you have the right idea here.

No its not, but it's a little of the same in Debian: the DPL shoudn't 
necessarily have packages.  Remember it's volunteer work here, so I'd like 
to make it easier esp. sine the board members will be putting a fair 
amount of effort into SPI.  Also, I think that there should be an option 
(however small) for non contributing members to become board members.  I 
think this is highly unlikely, but say we need a financial expert on the 
board who hasn't worked with free software before for example.

Then you have to define what happens when a contributing memebr slips into 
non contrib.  I think this way is easy, and really see no need to remove 
inactive supporting members.  Otherwise I'd me for a longer term (4-5 
years possibly).

Two years.  One year rolls around too soon, and I also think that there's 
the potential for someone to take time off from free software work 
(work/personal issues etc.) so I think 2 years is just right.  Keeps the 
workload down on the membership committee too.  Remember- they're 
volunteers.

[Here is the first 'real' cut at writing the article since most people 
seemed to agree with the basic principles.  I think this looks fairly 
good, but I'm sure it could use a little polishing.

--Nils.]


MEMBERSHIP
----------

Membership in this organization shall be open to all who meet the approval 
of the membership committee.  Members have the right and responsibility of 
overseeing the board members, officers, and committees and ensuring that 
they operate in accordance with the goals and principles of the 
organization.  All board members, officers, and committees are ultimately 
responsible to the membership, and should act in accordance with its 
wishes.

Contributing and non-contributing membership are available within 
this organization.  Members agree to help further and support the 
principles and goals of this organization.  All membership applications 
and renewals will be reviewed by the Membership Committee.  Applicants 
must meet the criteria set forth in the charter of the Membership 
Committee.

Members wishing to leave the organization may do so at any time by 
notifying the membership committee of their desire for the membership to 
be terminated.


Contributing Members
--------------------

  To become a contributing member the applicant must apply for a 
contributing membership and include a list of projects or free software 
related activities that they have participated in (and what they 
specifically have done) within the last two years (more may be included if 
desired).

   The contributing membership will expire two years from the date of 
issue of the membership.  The member will be notified one month before the 
expiration of the membership and will be asked to send a renewal 
application with a list of projects or free software related activities 
that they have participated in within the last two years.  If the 
membership is not renewed, the member status will be downgraded to a 
non-contributing member.  To again become a contributing member at a later 
time, the person can simply follow the renewal process.

   Board members, by virtue of their office, are automatically granted the 
status of contributing members.


Non-contributing Membership
---------------------------

 To become a non contributing member, the applicant must apply for a 
non-contributing membership. The membership will not expire.

Perhaps it's time to address the issue of whether we'll have the
(hu)manpower needed to manually reinstate a member every year. I know that
some of this could be automated, but the automation will inevitably
require a responsible, quick-to-reply set of maintainers, in much the same
way as the debian new-maintainer list does.

With the automation, I don't see why it'd be a large problem.  Debian has
functioned pretty well with it's new maintainer team...  SPI, if it has
that big if a membership work load, should also have a larger pool of
volunteers that can be tapped for projects such as this.

You bring up a fundamental problem in volunteer organizations. (This is
what I call "The Little Red Hen" problem.)

In support of removing such problems where possible, I keep returning to
the following questions:

Why should membership have a duration?

Does the value of a contribution deminish over time?

Are we considering any other conditions that would "remove" a member?


I can see no reason, once a person has "qualified" for membership, that we
should ever terminate that membership unless the member specifically
requests such termination.

Why do I think this? The reasoning goes like this:

   1. All of the requirements for membership involve some level of
      contribution to the Free Software Movement.

   2. Once membership is obtained, work done for SPI becomes a
      contribution to the FSM.

   3. Members who make no contribution have their "influence" reduced.


One of the components of the "Corporate Charter" (Which is the DNA of SPI)
is an educational responsibility. I know this sounds like a totally
unrelated issue, but it speaks to the need for more than one "class" of
member. By making "full membership" contingent on a reasonably high level
of commitment to Free Software we keep SPI's goals under the control of
the "right" people. By providing an "associate membership" for the rest of
the world, we provide an educational interface for the uninformed "general
public", as well as an avenue for contribution by individuals and
corporations who would otherwise not qualify for SPI membership.

Waiting is,

Dwarf

How about to just keep the rolls (or atleast the "all important"
contributing member rolls) down to people who are active?  If nobody every
expired, and people just dropped out (it happens a lot) we could end up
with way too many people to satisfy any quorum...  

Just a thought.  I'd have to think if I actually believe it's a real
problem on an imagined one.

> Does the value of a contribution deminish over time?
of course not... but availability does.  If we had a "sure fire" way to
make sure people didn't just "disappear" like happens from time to time
with Debian... either way, it'll be some amount of work for someone(s).
The expiration way is more automatable.

> Are we considering any other conditions that would "remove" a member?
Violation of the goals and such of SPI, I suppose.. but that could be
specified in the Membership Committee Charter...

Isn't one month a bit short? I'ld rather see that extended to 3 months.

Also, you list two types of membership here, but don't say what their
difference will be. Can I assume that will be determined by other
sections of the bylaws?

I was interested in 

"I guess we are finding out that there are many open
source spokesmen, but Eric owns the Open Source Initiative trademark"

Now, is there such a thing as the OSI(tm) or is he refering to the OS(tm) and
if so, shouldn't SPI at least contradict this?

Wondering,
Luis.

AFAICT there is no such thing as the OSI(tm), only the OS(tm) and SPI is 
the owner of that and it it being managed by OSI at present.  
www.uspto.gov can verify this- just do a search for Open Source.

The only two listed are SPI's "Open Source" and OSS.NET,  which is "Open
Source Solutions Net" at http://www.oss.net.

I had never understood the right to privacy to be a goal of Free Software
licensing. The GPL, in fact, arguably removes the right to keep personal
coding techniques private.

Agreed. Still, are we saying that this is "not fatal" in the sense that
a license with this property is still Free Software?

So, then perhaps the requirement to make your code available publicly if used
for commercial purposes is ok but the termination of copyright due to patent
litigation is not.

I agree that this is a "bug" in their license. But this touches on the 
larger and more complex matter of "Free" but incompatible licenses. As
the GPL demonstrates, limiting the use of your intellectual property to 
a particular sphere of other licensed material is apparently fair play.

You realize, of course, that with a membership of 50,000 (which I consider
conservative) we would probably end up authenticating some 2,000 renewals
per month. I have grave concerns regarding our ability to create a 
membership infrastructure that is able to actually assess the participation
of potential members in various free software projects. Perhaps some sort
of "vouching scheme" would be possible, but is obviously fairly easily
defeated.

Just curious, is it intentional that Eric Raymond is still listed as
managing the 'Open Source' trademark? If so, why? He is clearly not fit to
be managing it with the whole APSL mess going on.

Also, does SPI have any intentions of enforcing the trademark wrt to Apple
using it to endorse their APSL license?

Thanks,

	       The GPL, in fact, arguably removes the right to keep personal
    coding techniques private.

I would not say that.

    So, then perhaps the requirement to make your code available publicly if used
    for commercial purposes is ok but the termination of copyright due to patent
    litigation is not.

You have misinterpreted my words; that is not what I intended to say.

Ordinarily I would try to explain what I did intend to say, but I am
getting frustrated with your tendency to misunderstand things I have
said, and throw your misunderstandings back at me aggressively.  If
you are going to misunderstand no matter what I do, I may as well
minimize the time I spend explaining.

Keeping up with "active" members is much easier than deciding whether or
not they have met "qualification requirements" for each year they "claim"
membership.

I simple membership list ping, before meetings, would determine who was
active and who wasn't. If they can be reached, they should still have the
opportunity to vote.

But if they "just disapear", so what? 

I had the impression that the increased management of members was intended
to make sure that all participants were "qualified" in some way, and not
just casual (or malicious) interlopers with a mistaken interest in the
organization.

Once you "qualify" as a member, your active participation is a positive
thing, but I don't see that your, possibly temporary, lack of
participation indicates a "drag" on SPI resourses that must be rectified
by removal of the non-participant member.

Until a member doesn't want their name on the membership rolls, I see no
reason to remove them.

As with Debian, I see no reason to go beyond gaining assurances at the
beginning that the applicant does, in fact, agree with the principles of
the organization. I have participated in "discussions" with other Debian
developers where my belief in the principles of Free Software became
questioned because of a position I took in opposition to the PC one being
promoted. I would hate to fear expulsion for displaying unpopular ideas in
an SPI member forum.

If we do not allow deviations from the pre-defined course of SPI, then the
ship will only go in one direction, and can never be changed. This would
be a drastic mistake from my POV.

Luck,

That's okay.  Most of my response are intended to get people to think.  I

I'm thinking of voting and such...

Lets say we have 1000 people on the roles but, because of people
disappearing we have only 100 active people... or 100 active people who
will vote on any given issue, anyway.  Given Debian's voting rules, any
single choice would have to get 48 MORE votes than any other choice...

Otherwise the issue is unresolved.

Ah! Now I understand ;-)

Well, I thought that voting was TBD, and was, for the sake of argument,
being left 'til later. (I'm not sure that I completely agree with this,
but it has made the discussion easier so far)

This assumes that SPI will "naturally" adopt Debian's voting rules.

Given the broad membership that SPI is expected to acquire, a direct
democracy would be quite inefficient for "getting the job done".

Think of SPI as a "representative democracy", where the membership votes
for its representative, in the form of the board, and those
representatives actually "decide" on the particulars of what SPI is
"about". With adequate checks and balances, this produces a system that
has both the ability to decide in a hurry, coupled with the capability of
long involved contemplation of those decissions and actions.

But it seems that I too, have digressed into the issues of voting, rather
than staying with the question of who should be a member.

One last off-topic-comment: Before each vote, "active" members would be
asked to register for the vote. The number of registered voters would then
determine what "majority" or "super majority" would mean in this
particular vote.

Under normal voting conditions, you know when you have a yes vote, and you
know when you have a no vote, but when you recieve no vote at all, you
don't know whether it is from the voter being unwilling to vote one way or
the other, or the voter is unable to render a vote at all. As those who
are unable to render a vote, will also be unable to render a reply to the
call for registration, the last group is more clearly identified as
abstaining voters.

Just my POV,

Dwarf

It is.. but it's hard to forget about things like that, totally.  I resort
to not talking about what *should* the quorum be and such.

Not really.  It was just a real world example.  If there was a, say, 25%
quorum, that means 250 more votes.  If there was a 10%, that's 100 votes.
Any "realistic" quorum could be a problem.  Infact, any measurements taken
on "number of members" could be a problem.  This would be in issue to even
vote in the board if that was the only vote members were allowed to make
(like it is in many stockholders meetings).

[snipped alot of good stuff *because* it's not a vote discussion yet]

That would eliminate the need to remove inactive members from the roll..
but it would seem easier to send a ping message out, automaticly, every two
years and anyone who doesn't reply is moved out of the rolls (say, to the
non-contrib rolls or a third class could be inactive-contrib).  Automated,
it could even be sent only if you don't have an email coming from you in
the archives for the last 12 months or something.

Or have ABSTAIN as one of the options that can be voted on...

> Just my POV,
If the potential members here would not mind "registering" to vote before
each vote, then the only object I'd have to not expiring is taken care of.

[Second cut.  
-Some spelling fixes, changes to 'contrib member requirements' 
(simplified, details can go in charter)
- took out the membership time frame (good point, Ean..)- we'll specify 
that in the membership committee charter.  I'm trying to make is so the 
bylaws only need to be edited in extreme circumstances.

I like it in this form, and unless someone has objections/changes to 
voice, would like to leave this and move on to the COMMITTEE section (we 
can again discuss this when it's time to move all the articles into the 
bylaws...).  I think that working on that section before working on the 
voting will give us a better picture of the voting itself as I think the 
committees will play a large part in helping run SPI.

MEMBERSHIP
----------

Membership in this organization shall be open to all who meet the approval 
of the membership committee.  Members have the right and responsibility of 
overseeing the board members, officers, and committees and ensuring that 
they operate in accordance with the goals and principles of the 
organization.  All board members, officers, and committees are ultimately 
responsible to the membership, and should act in accordance with its 
wishes.

  Contributing and non-contributing memberships are available within 
this organization.  Members agree to support the principles and help 
further the goals of this organization.  All membership applications and 
renewals will be reviewed by the Membership Committee.  Applicants must 
meet the criteria set forth in the charter of the Membership Committee.

Members wishing to leave the organization may do so at any time by 
notifying the membership committee of their desire for the membership to 
be terminated.


Contributing Members
--------------------

  To become a contributing member the applicant must apply for a 
contributing membership and include a list of contributions made to the 
free software community.

   The contributing membership will expire as specified in the membership 
committee charter.  The member will be notified before the expiration of 
the membership and will be asked to send a renewal application with a list 
of projects or free software related activities that they have 
participated in within the previous membership term.  If the membership is 
not renewed, the member status will be downgraded to a non-contributing 
member.  To again become a contributing member at a later time, the member 
can simply follow the renewal process.

   Board members, by virtue of their office, are automatically granted the 
status of contributing members.


Non-contributing Membership
---------------------------

 To become a non contributing member, the applicant must apply for a 
non-contributing membership.  This membership will not expire.

This is the beginning of the discussion for the committee article of the 
bylaws.  Here are some basic principles which I feel should apply to the 
committees.

- they should take care of most of the day to day operation of SPI
  [this takes the workload off the BOD]
- their rights and responsibilities should be completely described in 
their charter
- they should be governed by the board of directors
  [what does this really mean?  I'm not sure yet... but that's who they 
should 'report' to]
- the BOD should be able to issue charters (i.e. create committees)
  [I'm thinking that if the consensus is that a new committee is needed, 
the BOD can issue a charter.  The membership should definitely have some 
input here though. how? By helping write the charter.]


QUESTIONS:
----------
- how are leaders appointed?  I'd say by the BOD, possibly the membership.
- how are members appointed?  BOD?  Leader?  Membership?
- should non-contributing members be able to serve on committees? 
[incidentally, that would automatically make them contributing 
members...!!]
- what do we do if a committee is no longer necessary?  disband it.  How? 
BOD vote?


I'm sure there are other issues here that I'm not addressing... please 
bring them up if you think of them!  As I think you can see, this 
discussion is one step closer to the voting discussion, as this will bring 
up a lot of issues regarding who controls what and why. I think that when 
we're done with this discussion, the voting discussion will be a lot 
easier because the political infrastructure will be in place.

Enjoy...
Nils.

I would rather favor having individuals making those decisions. Committees
are useful if you want to slow down any possible dangerous decisions or 
if power needs to be controller but Committees are not useful for day to
day operations. I would like this to be as non-political as possible. So
far we have had a pretty informal structure and it worked mostly.

Could we make all of this as simple as possible? This looks more and more
to me as if we are building a big administrative apparatus.

I would like to see a list of jobs for individuals within SPI and then a
responsibility to the BOD.

A lot of people have been saying this and I am now taking it upon myself
to make as official a proposal as I possibly can.  Yes, it's long. 
If you want to flame me for the length, do it in private (this means you
Branden...  =>)

I formally propose that SPI step in and take control of its intellectual
property.  At the moment OSI does seem to retain the privilege outlined
above even though the SPI board and most of those in SPI's affiliated
projects seem very unhappy with OSI's management.

So far I can name two such instances in which non-free licenses are being
called Open Source.  The first is Apple's license, which has been
discussed to death by now I'm certain.  OSI has directly claimed this
license to be Open Source---something which not only SPI but Debian and
Bruce Perens as well say does not meet the letter of the Open Source
Definition, much less the spirit.

The other real recent example may or may not have been directly endorsed
by OSI---I don't know for certain.  The bitkeeper license is NOT Open
Source, het it has been called such.  OSI should have by this time done
something about this.  If they have, I can't find anything about it.


And, as we know in the case of Apple's license, Eric Raymond has
responded to the joint statement issued by SPI, Debian, and Bruce
essentially saying it was his opinion that the Apple license was Open
Source and that was that.  Supposedly anything that was Open Source was
suitable for Debian's main distribution because of the direct
relationship between the Debian Free Software Guidelines and the Open
Source Definition.  The Apple license is the first major case in which
a license has been declared Open Source which fails the DFSG.


The story could end there, but it need not.  SPI still owns the Open
Source service mark.  OSI has been given authority to manage the mark.  I
propose SPI revoke that permission and send a cease and desist letter to
OSI immediately.  If OSI is not willing to accept the Open Source
Definition and the oppinions of a large number (perhaps even a large
majority) of the community when making its determination, then obviously
neither of these things truly matter to them.

I propose we stop this madness right now, once and for all.  Eric Raymond
didn't invent Free Software, he didn't even invent the suit-friendly
label for it "Open Source".  He did CatB and got a fair amount of support
for the paper.  My opinion (purely my own but shared by more than a
couple I am certain) is that Eric has let his ego guide his actions of
late.  My signature (I swear this thing is psychic!) demonstrates the
problem clearly.  Eric is more interested in software that doesn't suck
than the Free Software principles of the Open Source Definition.

Eric has indicated he wants to go back to his family and normal life. 
Family is important.  It's clear to me after reading a short comment from
Bruce (uncharacteristically short!  *ducks*) and thinking about it
overnight that he's right.  This job Eric has been trying to fill is too
big for one person to handle on their own.  Let's take the burden off his
back and distribute it evenly among those we believe will represent us
best.  Preferably these people should understand both companies' need to
profit and willingness to support Open Source IFF it is profitable and
the needs of the community to have quality Free Software.

True. We should do that for Debian as well, but I'm not in a hurry
there since Debian already works fine.

Help writing the chapter and of course being able to revoke the creation
of a new committee via a vote.

Have people from the membership volunteer and let the BOD make the final
choice I think.

Another quite common option is to select a leader and let him choose the
rest of the committee if you're forming a new committee. If a current
leader is replace a new leader is chosen by the BOD and the current
committee, with advise from the leaving leader.

I think a committee should have to disband itself.

That depends on their size and internal organization. For example
the ftpmaster team for Debian basically is a committee and they appear
to do very useful day to day operations ..

We are going to need the politics at a certain point anyway; see what
happened to Debian. Without the constitution which has the same amount
of politics things would get (be?) messy.

Umm. They dont work as a committee. And even their disagreements spoil
over to debian-private. Anyways maybe we can frame it in the form of a
committee with a chairman able to do and delegate things. I talked with
Nils on irc about that. I just dont want the common committee nature which
I have seen. It will make swift action impossible. Such a committee for
daily operations is deadly for an organization.

This is a double edged sword. Too much regulation can cause a mess as
well.

I see a committee as a group of people with a certain task and a single
leader. How they organize themselves is entirely up to the committee
itself. Different committees will probably warrant different structures.

Having them and having to use them all the time are different things.
Or do you think that the constitution is hindering or regulating
too much in Debian?

In fact, any decision of the BOD or any committee should be overridable by
a vote of the membership.. but the process should be made troublesome
enough that every person with a hair on their pimple can't contest
everything.

No, it should be able to be disbanded by the BOD, also.  They're the ones

pretty informal works for an informal group like a Free Software project.
However, SPI is a legal entity and needs more structure, if for no other
reason, to protect itself.

It doesn't have to be overly complicated, either, just "clear" (quotes
because clear means in the eyes of various regulatory bodies).  Still,
some formality is necessary or clarity.

There's noting "administrative" in what's been done yet... 'cept somehow a
membership roll (well, two) has to be kept...  Committees.  Having
committees doesn't make it administrative.  It might slow things down.. and
it might be necessary to build a safeguard against that (teams, instead of
committees where speed is important).. but it is a necessity to define
what's going to take place...

We are talking about bylaws. Bylaws can be decided upon by the
governing body. This is not the constitution.

How would the membership delegate those things? Election?

How about a petition scheme. If a petition is pgp signed by 10% of the
membership then a vote will be taken which can override any decision of
leadership?

That depends on the situation I would think but we need to have some kind
of governing structure that approves these things. Hopefully simple.

It would be dangerous if the technical oversight committee disbanded
itself. Depends on the committee. Keep it flexible.

Problem is "committee" could mean either "group of people charged with
a task" (similar to what Debian does with d-admin, webmaster,
ftpmaster roles) or "group of bureaucrats who have to have a formal
vote to accomplish anything" (which is how the SPI Board currently
operates).

If these committes are to perform any major function, we can only hope
they act more like task forces than real committees.  :-)

I'd prefer a seconds approach, personally.  Maybe 10% of the body "seconds"
it... but 10% of the people have to sign?  100+ signatures on one document?
Maybe I'm misunderstanding you...

The BOD accepts and appoints the committee members... no approval necessary
for them choosing their own leader.

yes. 100+ signatures on one document in order to get a vote by all
members on an issue. Basically to reverse a decision of the leadership in
sticky situations. maybe we can make it less than 10%?

Yes, simplicity is definitely a goal, but you have to leave room for the 
organization to grow and mature, so a certain complexity is needed.

  Here I disagree a little (we had this discussion on IRC, I'm repeating 
here for everyone elses benefit).  It may be easier with individuals, but 
I think you need a committee so that there is always someone else who can 
also do the work.  Off course the committees should be more or less 
reactive, depending on what they are in charge of.  This is left up to 
their charters I think...

I spoke with Larry McVoy on the phone yesterday, it's very clear that he
is _not_ promoting the license as Open Source, and OSI is not accepting it
as such.

    What a little more disturbing was seeing ESR asked in an interview
about the "New Copyleft" license.  He said it might be time to rethink the
Open Source Definition to include such a beast.  I wish I had the
reference.
   Anyway, I think this kind of statement bodes very badly for the
OpenSource trademark, if SPI doesn't assert its ownership of the mark.

   This is not to say I think ESR is evil.  I have been very disturbed to
see some of the comments on slashdot, and in articles, regarding this
division over the Open Source tm.  Frankly, the subtext of ESR's
announcements always seem to indicate that he's really for free software,
but sees gaining market share (and attracting commercial companies) is the
only realistic way to gain the mind share of the public and demarginalize
the issue.  In a very real way he's correct - any time you want to take a
radical position and make it more acceptable, you have to move the middle
ground in that direction.  Also, I agree with his analysis of the benefits
of making the source available, even if its not free, because it does
benefit the people who, for one reason or another, feel they must use that
platform.  So, in general, I see any move toward more liberal licensing of
code as progress towards the overall goal of free software.

   That said, I also believe the purpose of the Open Source trademark
should not so much be to help advertise products as to inform the consumer
as to the status of the license.  This is especially important in light of
all the various licenses that have been proliferating lately.  In this
regard, I believe the branding body (whether OSI, or a committee of SPI)
should play a role analagous to Consumer Reports, though it does allow the
use of the "rating" in advertising.  Perhaps we should consider "levels"
of Open Source, rather than a simple binary switch.  Then would could
these levels to indicate where in the spectrum a license falls, so the
developer wouldn't have to read the license looking for tricky legalese.
Actually, "levels" might not be quite right either, as the classification
might not be strictly hierarchical, but it would be a start.

A few reorganizations, additions and clarifications.  Please comment on it, 
esp. on the few items left in the question section.  Hopefully we can finish 
this by the middle of next week.  Then it's on to voting!

of the day to day operation of SPI

- committees should perform ongoing functions and should not be formed to 
accomplish short term tasks

- they should be governed by the BOD, meaning they report to the BOD, and 
the BOD can override their decisions (if necessary- this should be an 
extreme case)

- they are accountable to the BOD and the membership

- if a committee is no longer necessary it should be disbanded.  This can be 
done by the BOD or a vote of the membership.

- committees can propose resolutions and motions


Charter
-------
- their charter should completely describe their rights and responsibilities 
- the BOD issues and revoke charters (i.e. create and disband committees).  
The membership should help write the charter.
 

Leadership and Membership
-------------------------
- the BOD appoints the committee leadership (leaders and alternates)


QUESTIONS:
----------
- how are members appointed?  BOD?  Leaders?  Membership?  Actually, should 
the committee have an official membership?  The membership of a committee 
should be 'slow moving' i.e. committees should not have a 'revolving door' 
membership with a quick turnover.  How do we accomplish this?

- should non-contributing members be able to serve on committees? 
[incidentally, that would automatically make them contributing 
members...!!  I would say no, as I envision committees doing the more 
'important' work and to be a member you should have done some free software 
work already.  Off course, they can help with committee work, just not be a 
member.  That in turn would qualify them for contributing membership 
eventually.]

- what should the internal structure of the committee look like? how are 
decisions reached within a committee?  Voting?  Consensus?  Should there be 
a general specification for this, or should this be left up to the charter?  
[I'd say leave it up to the charter.  The membership committee and 
administrative committee should be a lot more reactive, and (for example) an 
Open Source committee or other more politically oriented committees should 
be more slow moving and stable.]

Day to day operations are short term tasks and require ongoing decision
making. Maybe I am confused here about the nature of committees.

committees are formed around an issue. This could be by members sharing a
certain interest or by the BOD organizing a committee or appointing
someone to start a committee. Powers to make decisions are conferred to
the committee by the BOD. Unless a committee has the power to make
decisions in a certain they can only submit recommendations
to the BOD.

Of course

Maybe leave that up to the committee. The chairman needs to be responsible
for the actions to the BOD to have accountability.

Hi,

For those who haven't seen it, http://www.opencode.org.

Seems to be a project by law students and "internet activists" to get end
users involved in free software, support free software development, and 
work on free software advocacy. I don't know anything about it beyond the
web site, so add a grain of salt, but it looks cool.

The problem is that these guys are not free software developers, and may
not represent our interests. On the other hand, the essay on that site
shows that their heart is in the right place, it appears that they have
good legal/academic/lobbyist connections, and IMO involving end users in
this way is a 200% more exciting goal than getting yet another big
corporation to donate some token code. (My free software work has been on
the Debian Tutorial and Gnome, so clearly their goals and mine are
similar. :-)

I would like to see SPI the developer's organization work very closely
with them. I'd like to see them contributing to Debian; to achieve their
goals they need a 100% free operating system, and Debian is the only one
right now.

SPI needs people to do outreach, advocacy, lobbying, finance, legal stuff.
They need people to write code, and they need free software "street cred."
Could be a great pairing.

They are also not yet organized and their goals aren't set in stone;
there's some sort of online meeting on May 20, and SPI members should be
there pushing for something like the Social Contract and advocating
developer's interests. Maybe the H2O people can even become a part of SPI
instead of starting their own group. Anyway, I plan to get involved with
this if I can and I hope others will give it some thought too.

Thanks,
Havoc

What sort of vote?  Quorum,  two-thirds?

> Actually, should the committee have an official membership? 
Yes.  If a comittee is going to "be responsible for the day-to-day running
of SPI" (i.e.,  they're going to make day-to-day descisions on behalf of
the company),  we may eventually end up in legal trouble if there's no one
who is officially responsible.

> - should non-contributing members be able to serve on committees? 
> - what should the internal structure of the committee look like?
On the same tack,  should committees be required to hold discussion on
publically-available lists?  I understand that in some cases this simply
isn't an option,  but in many cases it might be best if all committee
discussions were done in front of the world.  Maybe a list for the
committee which only the committee can send to,  but everybody can read?

Why?  Why can the BOD not form a "team" to work with apple on developing an
Open Source license?  Once the license is done, the "team" (I like team
better than committee) is not needed and can be disbanded, naturally.  It
could even be written into the charter in such a way that it wouldn't take
a seperate action by the BOD to disband.  (But still satisfy the BOD
disbanding it).

> - committees can propose resolutions and motions
either "within the scope of their charter" or "of the type specified in
their charter" or "if allowed in their charter"... A committee on the OS
trademark shouldn't have any power to propose on an issue involving
membership.  The individual members will still have what ever powers the
bylaws give, but not the "team" as an "entity".

> Leadership and Membership

Structure should be left up to the charter.  Maybe (can't think of one off
the top of my head but maybe) a leader isn't necessary or even harmful to
the Foobard team... so they shouldn't have one.  Instead, the whole team
should be appointed by the BOD -- esp. since the "teams" are an extention
of the BOD.  If a leader is needed, the how the leader comes to be can be
spelled in the charter (in theory, some leaders can then be appointed by
the BOD, elected by the membership or chosen by the committee members).

see above.  I"m not sure "turnover" can be measured except by very careful
selection of the "team" members.

Or if yes, the membership should exclude being a committee member.

Charter defined...


Try to think of ALL the possible types of committees... then find the
ingredients that are in common that you want ALL the "teams" to have...
That is all that should be in the bylaws.  The rest should be in the
charters.

Agreed, they need to get a handle on things.  At this point I think "by
any means necessary" is required, but I guess SPI seems to be more
interested in trying to resolve this peacefully if they can.

You'll forgive me for being pessimistic and cynnical about it and saying
I'll believe that will achieve the desired results when I see them.

The problem is, there's only so far that it's safe to go..  Corporations
want him to go further and some corporations supposedly "on our side"
(but whom I really believe aren't at all on "our side") are helping push
him that way.  The problem I'm seeing is that he's doing what they want. 
I don't think he realizes even.

Interesting thoughts..  A page for licenses determined to be Open Source
that talks about the restrictions they have might be a good idea.  I
don't think a "rating system" is a good idea as came to mind when I read
the words.  We don't need to score licenses on how cool they are.  But a
set of yes/no questions about the licenses would be good.  Someone did
something like that I think.

Then count me as one against.

SPI currently does not have any formal membership policies, or any means
for anyone but its board to control it.

SPI does not have a history of fast and effective action -- we're still
waiting for publication of all the comments it requested about who should
control the open source mark, and we still haven't made any decision on
that. At present we can't even say "yes" to an open source project that
asks us for CVS space.

SPI does not have a history of effective advocacy of free software to
business or the masses.

In short, I don't think SPI is well placed to do OSI's job, let alone do
it better.

Further, OSI is making efforts in the right direction. They are discussing
how the APSL should be improved with Apple, and they've now published a
list of board members. Sure. They're still a way off being open enough
themselves, but this isn't the way to go about improving matters.

Cheers,
aj

I don't speak for anyone save myself. PGP encrypted mail preferred.

Say what? All public disclosure from OSI indicates that they are dragging
their feet about any change in the APSL, nor has anyone at Apple indicated
that OSI is working on this.
